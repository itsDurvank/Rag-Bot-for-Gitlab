# Project Description

## What This Project Does

This project creates an intelligent AI chatbot that can have natural conversations about GitLab's extensive company documentation. Think of it as having a knowledgeable assistant who has read thousands of pages of GitLab's handbook and can instantly answer questions about their company culture, engineering practices, product strategy, and business direction.

## Key Capabilities

### ðŸ¤– Smart Document Understanding
- The chatbot has "read" and understood over 2,000 pages of GitLab's official documentation
- It can find relevant information from both their company handbook (culture, policies, processes) and strategic direction documents (business goals, product roadmap)
- Uses advanced AI to understand the context and meaning of questions, not just keyword matching

### ðŸ’¬ Natural Conversation
- You can ask questions in plain English, just like talking to a knowledgeable colleague
- The bot remembers previous parts of your conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions
- Provides detailed, well-formatted answers with bullet points and clear explanations

### ðŸ“š Transparent Sources
- Shows exactly which part of GitLab's documentation was used to answer each question
- Provides citations so you can verify information and learn more
- Maintains accuracy by only answering from official GitLab materials

## Goals and Scope

### Primary Goals
1. **Make complex documentation accessible**: Transform thousands of pages of text into an easy-to-use conversational interface
2. **Demonstrate RAG technology**: Show how Retrieval-Augmented Generation can solve real business problems
3. **Create a production-ready application**: Build something that could actually be used by GitLab employees or people interested in joining the company

### Project Scope
- **Input**: GitLab's official handbook and direction documents (text files)
- **Processing**: Break documents into chunks, create vector embeddings, store in searchable database
- **Interface**: Web-based chat application built with Streamlit
- **AI Engine**: Google's Gemini AI model for generating responses
- **Output**: Conversational AI assistant accessible through a web browser

## Final Output

The end result is a fully functional web application where users can:
- Type questions about GitLab in a chat interface
- Receive intelligent, contextual answers in real-time
- See exactly which documents were used to generate each answer
- Have multi-turn conversations with context retention
- Access this from any web browser without technical setup

## Real-World Impact

This type of system solves a common problem in large organizations: **information accessibility**. Instead of employees spending hours searching through documentation or asking colleagues, they can get instant, accurate answers from an AI assistant that never gets tired and is available 24/7.

The project demonstrates how AI can make organizational knowledge more democratic and accessible, which is especially valuable for:
- New employee onboarding
- Training and education
- Policy clarification
- Strategic alignment
- Remote team collaboration
