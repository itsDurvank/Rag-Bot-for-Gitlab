## **Overview**

Professional Services Engineers engage with customers to provide installation, migration, training, and advisory services. They handle installations ranging from single-node Omnibus installs, to our largest reference architectures utilizing IaC/CaC, execute migrations from multiple systems to GitLab SaaS or self-hosted, and providing advisory services across the entire GitLab feature stack.

Professional Services Engineers are expected to be able to interface not only with the customer, but with our GitLab Product/Engineering teams, to find the best route for customer success, and to help drive improvements into GitLab features and processes.
