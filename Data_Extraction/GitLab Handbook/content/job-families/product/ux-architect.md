## UX Architect Roles at GitLab

At GitLab, UX Architects collaborate closely with product designers, product managers, engineers, and technical writers to ensure cohesive, scalable, and systematic user experiences across the platform. They focus on the high level interaction models, information architecture, workflows, and usability heuristics that shape how users interact holistically with the product.

UX Architects take a strategic, birds-eye view of the overall GitLab product while also contributing hands-on, ensuring that information architecture and system behaviors support a unified and intuitive user experience. They establish system-wide principles that guide teams in delivering consistent, high-quality UX solutions across different product areas.

### Base Requirements

- Deep understanding of information architecture principles and methodologies.
- Several years of experience architecting complex enterprise software systems.
- Strong technical background with ability to understand system capabilities and constraints.
- Proven experience using data and research to formulate logical business recommendations.
- Demonstrated ability to balance strategic thinking with the urgency to drive work forward.
- Applied expertise in technology, process, and workflows leveraged by product.
- Experience influencing cross-functional teams and prioritizing deliverables.
- Experience with taxonomy development and content modeling.
- Expertise in user flow mapping and system diagramming.
- Proven track record of documentation and technical writing.
- Strong understanding of accessibility standards and their architectural implications.
- Comfort working in a highly agile, iterative product development process.
- You share our values, and work in accordance with those values.
- Strong bias for action and ability to develop daily priorities to achieve goals.
- Proficiency in English language, both written and verbal, sufficient for success in a remote and largely asynchronous work environment.
- Working knowledge of Git workflows and DevOps principles.
