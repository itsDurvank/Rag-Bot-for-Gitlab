description: "The tax department is responsible for GitLab's overall tax strategy including all components of tax compliance, tax planning and accounting for income taxes.

## Contacting the Tax Team

The Tax Team is responsible for GitLab's tax compliance (see here for payroll taxes), tax planning and accounting for business taxes, including income taxes and indirect taxes such as sales taxes and value-added taxes (VAT). Taxation differs between countries, and taxation in one country is not always complementary to taxation in another country, resulting in possible double-taxation on the same GitLab revenue. It is the fundamental goal of the Tax Team to minimize double taxation, to optimize our global effective tax rate, and to timely apply resources to various company needs. Those needs range from routine compliance and tax audits to strategically positioning the company for its next phase of growth.

## Organization

The Tax team is part of the Finance function and headed by the VP Tax. The VP Tax reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax team is structured to address (a) U.S. domestic taxes and global accounting for business taxes and (b) international tax planning and compliance, including US international tax planning.

## Frequently Asked Questions - Tax ID for non-US customers

### What is a Tax ID?

An Indirect Tax Identification Number (“Indirect Tax ID” or “Tax ID”) is a unique identification number assigned by tax authorities to businesses registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), Goods and Services Tax (GST), or similar indirect taxes. This number identifies your business as a registered taxpayer eligible to charge and collect indirect taxes.

### Why does GitLab need my Indirect Tax ID?

GitLab is required to comply with local tax regulations in various jurisdictions. When you provide a valid Indirect Tax ID:

- GitLab may not need to charge VAT/GST on your invoices (reverse charge mechanism)
- It helps ensure proper tax compliance for both parties
- It may reduce your overall tax burden on GitLab services

Without a valid Indirect Tax ID, GitLab may be required to charge applicable VAT/GST rates based on your location.

### What if my business is not registered for VAT/GST?

If your business is not registered for indirect taxes (due to size thresholds or other reasons), you may not have an Indirect Tax ID. In such cases, GitLab will charge the applicable VAT/GST rate according to local regulations.
