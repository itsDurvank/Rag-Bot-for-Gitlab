This guide is intended to help Meetup organizers run events that their community will love. Our aim is to be as comprehensive as possible to enable everyone to become an organizer, regardless of experience. Happy planning!

## Why Should You Get Involved

The reasons for getting involved in a meetup community include:

* **Connecting with your community** - Meetups tend to bring together folks with similar interests and values. Meeting and networking with like-minded individuals helps build lasting professional relationships.

* **Expanding your skill set** - Whether you're new to tech or looking to develop new skills, meetups are an opportunity to develop core skills needed for success - particularly communication and collaboration.

* **Pursuing your passion** - If you're passionate about a technology or programming language, meetups are a way to grow interest in those topics, increase your influence in their community, and help advocate and champion them.

## Planning an In-Person Meetup

### What to Do ASAP

* **Find speakers** - Reach out to potential speakers and confirm their availability and topics.

* **Find a venue** - Cafes, community centers, coworking spaces, and local tech companies are common venues for meetups.

* **Set the date** - This requires confirming availability of both venue and speaker.

* **Set up an event page** - Create a detailed event page with all relevant information.

* **Apply a Code of Conduct** - Ensure the safety and comfort of all participants. [GitLab's Code of Conduct](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) is a good option.

* **Promote the event** - Share with your target audience through appropriate channels.

### What to Do One Week Before Your Event

  * Will they need adapters?
  * Does this match venue capabilities?

* **Recruit volunteers** - Find help from your network or community for the day of the event.

* **Send reminders** - Contact guests about the event and encourage them to help promote it. Include a simple request: "Share this with your colleagues, friends, and on social media".
