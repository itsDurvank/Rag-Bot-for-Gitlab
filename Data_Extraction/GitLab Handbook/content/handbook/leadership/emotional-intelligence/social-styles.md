title: CliftonStrengths:Unlocking Team Potential at Gitlab
---

At GitLab, we believe that understanding and leveraging each team member's unique strengths is fundamental to building [high-performing teams](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-development/high-performing-teams/). CliftonStrengths provides a framework that helps us move beyond traditional team-building approaches to create truly exceptional teamsâ€“ by focusing on what we are already naturally good at. 

By providing us with the tool to recognize and leverage the diversity of strengths within our teams, we are empowered to:

1. Identify talents across team members 
2. Foster an environment where vulnerability is welcomed
3. Build the trust necessary for high performance 

## So what is CliftonStrengths?

**TL;DR**: CliftonStrengths helps you understand what you're naturally good at, so you can focus your energy on developing those talents into true strengths. 

[CliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx) is an assessment tool that helps people identify their natural talents and strengths. Based on decades of research by Gallup, this tool measures your natural patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving across 34 potential strength themes. Rather than focusing on fixing weaknesses, CliftonStrengths empowers you to discover and leverage what you naturally do ***best***.
