title: "Customer Product Usage Information"
description: "GitLab's Product Usage Data policies"
---

GitLab is committed to providing value and functionality through our free, open-source software and paid offerings (collectively, the "Software"). In order to continue innovating and supporting our growing user base, it is helpful to have in-depth knowledge of how our users are utilizing the Software, which we collect as certain metrics generated through a customer or a users' use of the Software ("Metrics"). To achieve the foregoing, GitLab collects information about how the features and functionality of the Software are used at an instance, namespace, or user level.

Instance or namespace level Metrics constitute total counts, such as the total number of projects, pipelines, issues, and merge requests related to that entire instance or namespace. These Metrics may also include an instance or namespace's settings, such as database_version or container_registry_enabled. User level Metrics are events related to specific user interactions with the Software, such as whether a user viewed a certain page or clicked a certain button in the Software. Subject to the exceptions described in the proceeding sections, the personal data of individual users is generally not collected.

The Metrics collected can be separated into three collection services: Service Ping, Snowplow, and License Sync (collectively, "Product Usage Data"). The details of each collection service can be found below, including the applicable Software type in which the Product Usage Data operates, the cadence for collection, and the types of Metrics collected.

## What are the data collection services that constitute Product Usage Data

As stated above, there are three collection services GitLab uses to generate Product Usage Data, which in turn allow us to invest more efficiently and continue to expand both the open source and paid Software offerings.

### Service Ping (formerly known as Usage Ping)

*Purpose*: GitLab collects Service Ping Metrics to collaborate with our customers to accelerate value attribution, achieve return-on-investment (ROI) goals, and accomplish business outcomes with the Software. Service Ping Metrics are composed of aggregate count Metrics related to an entire instance, tenant or namespace, as well as true/false Metrics regarding the enablement of certain settings or features. Aggregate counts are tallied in an "all-time" format and a "28-day" format. Please see our Service Ping FAQ [here](/handbook/customer-success/csm/service-ping-faq/).

*Applicable Software*: Service Ping Metrics are collected in the Self-Managed, GitLab.com and [Dedicated](https://about.gitlab.com/dedicated/) versions of the Software. Generally, "Service Ping" is the name of the technology that collects the applicable Metrics from individual Self-Managed installations and Dedicated. Since GitLab.com is essentially a GitLab-hosted multi-tenant version of a Self-Managed instance, a version of Service Ping has been implemented for GitLab.com and provides GitLab.com equivalent Metrics to what we achieve with Self-Managed instances. For more information on how Service Ping operates exclusive to Self-Managed instances, please see our [Service Ping Guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/internal_analytics/service_ping/).

*Configuration*: Self-Managed and Dedicated Service Ping payloads contain instance-level Metrics for each individual Self-Managed installation and Dedicated tenant. GitLab.com Service Ping Metrics relate to both the entire GitLab.com instance as well as every GitLab.com namespace. Additionally, page views are automatically instrumented on GitLab.com.

*Personal Data Collected*: Since Service Ping Metrics are aggregated, these Metrics generally do not relate to an individual and do not contain information about projects or usernames. However, there are two possible exceptions where Service Ping Metrics may relate to an identifiable person.

The first exception is in the collection of hostname and IP address for Self-Managed instances or Dedicated. These Metrics are intended to relate to the instance, but the personal data of a natural person could be collected depending on the Software type. For example, if the Self-Managed instance is installed in an individual's home server, we may get a home IP address. Similarly, the collection of a GitLab.com namespace could possibly contain the personal data of a natural person depending on the naming convention. The second exception is in the collection of paid licensee information. Because all Service Ping Metrics are correlated to an active licensee's name, email address, and company name, all Metrics collected by Service Ping may relate to that licensee.

*Data Sharing*: Service Ping Metrics are not shared with independent third-parties. The data is sent from Self-Managed instances, Dedicated or GitLab.com namespaces to the [Versions App](https://version.gitlab.com/) and our data warehouse for processing. These are GitLab-controlled systems.

*Cadence*: Service Ping collected via Self-Managed instances, Dedicated and GitLab.com namespaces are automatically generated on a weekly basis. The data will appear in our data warehouse within one-day after generation. Only the metrics that were instrumented through the version the Self-Managed instance is running on are available. For example, if a metric is instrumented during the development of version 16.9, it will be available on instances running versions equal to or greater than 16.9.

*Ownership*: Service Ping is owned by the [GitLab Analytics Instrumentation Group](/handbook/engineering/data-engineering/analytics/monitor/analytics-instrumentation/).

*Types of Data*: Service Ping Metrics have been broken down into the four categories of Metrics listed below:

- **Operational Data**: Operational Data is a collection of aggregated usage and true/false Metrics that we are contractually obligated to collect in order to render Customer Success Services. Operational Data tracks how value is delivered through the use of the Software and provides insights into optimal customer implementation.

   A full list of the Operational Data collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?category=operational).

- **Optional Data**: Optional Data is a collection of aggregated usage and true/false data generated by our users that is not required to support our day-to-day operations, yet provide valuable insights and knowledge that GitLab can use to improve our process, Software, and investment decisions. Optional Data compare counts month over month (or week over week) to get a rough sense for how an instance uses different Software features, collect other facts that help us classify and understand GitLab installations, and calculate our Stage Monthly Active Users (SMAU), which helps to measure the success of our stages and features.

    A full list of the Optional Data collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?category=optional).

- **Subscription Data**: Subscription Data is a collection of license-related Metrics synced to our data warehouse from Self-Managed instances on version 14.1 or higher and connected to the internet. This data is also collected from Dedicated and GitLab.com. As described in our Subscription Agreement, these Metrics are needed because they provide basic information on user count and instance version, which helps to facilitate discussions regarding customer behavior in the areas of provisioning and renewals.

    A full list of the Subscription Data collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?category=subscription).

- **Standard Data**: Standard Data is a collection of metadata, such as hostname and edition, that allows us to associate other Service Ping categories to the correct instance or namespace.  Collection of these Metrics must be enabled to properly correlate Service Ping metrics in our data warehouse between the other three categories of Service Ping Metrics.

    A full list of the Standard Data collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?category=standard). In addition, the IP address of an instance is another piece of metadata collected under this category.

*Opting-Out*: Each of the four Service Ping categories have different parameters regarding Opt-Out:

- **Operational Data**
  - <ins>Free Self-Managed instances (CE or EE Distribution)</ins>: Operational Data is not collected since the purpose of these Metrics are to assist customers with optimal use of the Software.
  - <ins>Paid Self-Managed instances (EE Distribution) and Dedicated </ins>: Operational Data is intended to be required and configuration is connected to your paid license. If you wish to opt-out you can speak with a GitLab sales representative or [contact support](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  If your instance is on an [Offline License](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/cloud-licensing/#cloud-licensing-exemptions), GitLab will not automatically collect Operational Data as long as the instance has followed the instructions for [disabling Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/usage_statistics.html#enable-or-disable-optional-data-in-service-ping).
  - <ins>Free and Paid GitLab.com users</ins>: Do-Not-Track ("DNT") signals may prevent the collection of certain Operational Data Metrics that relate to browser level aggregate totals, such as the number of times a button was clicked by a user with DNT signals enabled. However, please note that DNT signals depend on how the event is triggered and thus may not be recognized in all situations. Further, DNT signals will not prevent the collection of downstream non-synchronous Metrics. For  example, if a user with DNT enabled signals clicks a button to start a CI job, this button click will not be tracked. But if the same user pushes new code to a repository, thereby inciting an automated run of the same job, this run will be counted since it occurred non-synchronously from the user's direct action. Any other interactions that happen outside of the browser, such as a direct call to GitLab's API, may also be included in the Metrics.
- **Optional Data**:
  - <ins>Free and Paid Self-Managed instances (CE or EE distribution) or Dedicated</ins>: These Metrics are collected by default. Optional Data can be disabled through an in-app admin setting or through modifying the configuration file.  Please [visit our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/usage_statistics.html#enable-or-disable-optional-data-in-service-ping) to learn more.
  - <ins>Free and Paid GitLab.com users</ins>: Similar to Operational Data, DNT signals may prevent the collection of certain Optional Data Metrics that relate to browser level aggregate totals. However, please note that DNT signals depend on how the event is triggered and thus may not be recognized in all situations.
- **Subscription Data**:
  - <ins>Free Self-Managed instances (CE or EE distribution)</ins>: These Metrics are collected by default.  Subscription Data can be disabled through an in-app admin setting or through modifying the configuration file.  Please [visit our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/usage_statistics.html#enable-or-disable-usage-statistics) to learn more.
  - <ins>Paid Self-Managed instances (EE distribution) and Dedicated</ins>: Subscription Data collection is dependent on the license type used to activate your instance. Its collection is described in our Subscription Agreement. If you activate your instance using an activation code, usage data will be [automatically synchronized between your Self-Managed instance and GitLab on a daily basis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#subscription-data-synchronization). If your instance is on an [Offline License](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#export-your-license-usage), then no data will be automatically collected. Once a month, the instance admin will be prompted to manually submit usage data to GitLab by email, but this is not required.  Further, if your instance is on a [Legacy License](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/self-managed/cloud-licensing/#1-which-license-type-should-i-provide-for-an-approved-opt-out), then Subscription Data is not collected.
  - <ins>Free and Paid GitLab.com users</ins>: You cannot opt-out of Subscription Data for any of our GitLab.com offerings.
- **Standard Data**:
  - <ins>Free Self-Managed instances (CE or EE distribution)</ins>: These Metrics are collected by default.  Standard Data can be disabled through an in-app admin setting or through modifying the configuration file.  Please [visit our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/usage_statistics.html#enable-or-disable-usage-statistics) to learn more.
  - <ins>Paid Self-Managed instances (EE distribution) and Dedicated</ins>: Standard Data cannot be disabled.  However, if your instance is on an [Offline License](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#export-your-license-usage), GitLab will not automatically collect Standard Data as long as the instance has followed the instructions for [disabling Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/usage_statistics.html#enable-or-disable-optional-data-in-service-ping).
  - <ins>Free and Paid GitLab.com users</ins>: You cannot opt-out of Standard Data for any of our GitLab.com offerings.

### Snowplow

*Purpose*: GitLab operates a product intelligence platform in our infrastructure called Snowplow to collect user-level interactions within the GitLab.com version of the Software (e.g., viewing a specific page, clicking a button, etc). Snowplow is also integrated into Self-Managed and Dedicated deployments of the Software. This allows us to provide detailed usage information to customers and it allows us to understand how users navigate the product. Unlike with Service Ping, the Metrics collected are not aggregated across an entire namespace, instance or tenant. Instead, Snowplow Metrics are attributable to a specific user, subject to a subsequent pseudonymization process. For more information on Snowplow, please see our comprehensive [Internal Analytics documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/internal_analytics/).

*Applicable Software*: Snowplow Metrics are collected from free and paid users of GitLab.com, Self-Managed and Dedicated versions of the Software.

*Configuration*: The Snowplow collector takes user events in real time from GitLab.com, Self-Managed and Dedicated and sends these user Metrics through our pseudonymization process. At this stage, the Metrics are stripped of personal identifiers, subject to the exceptions below, but the Metrics are still attributable to a namespace, instance or tenant. For Self-Managed and Dedicated, this pseudonymization process occurs within the instance or tenant.

*Personal Data Collected*: Snowplow does collect the personal data of individual users in a raw format.  These raw Metrics, however, are sent through a pseudonymization process and subsequently purged, meaning only the pseudonymized Metrics are delivered to our data warehouse. These pseudonymized Metrics are still considered personal data under applicable data protection laws since these Metrics are capable of re-identification. GitLab, however, does not undertake any processes to re-identify or relate the Metrics back to individual users. There are two pieces of Snowplow Metrics that we do not pseudonymize: Project_ID and Namespace_ID/Group_ID.  We also collect the country and region of the user's location, but we do not store IP addresses.

*Data Sharing*: Snowplow Metrics are not shared with independent third-parties. All systems and software used in the collection and transfer of Snowplow Metrics are GitLab-controlled systems.

*Cadence*: Snowplow Metrics collected from Self-Managed, GitLab.com and Dedicated are sent to the data warehouse contemporaneously.

*Ownership*: Snowplow is owned by the [GitLab Analytics Instrumentation Group](/handbook/engineering/data-engineering/analytics/monitor/analytics-instrumentation/).

*Types of Metrics*: Snowplow Metrics are composed of all the pseudonymized user interaction Metrics found [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/events/), as well as Project_ID, Namespace_ID/Group_ID, and the country and region of the user's location.

*Opting-Out*: For GitLab.com, Snowplow Metrics pertain to individual pseudonymized user events and can only be opted-out on an individual basis using DNT signals.  However, please note that DNT signals depend on how the event is triggered and thus may not be recognized in all situations. For Self-Managed and Dedicated, Snowplow Metrics can be disabled through an in-app admin setting. In addition, please see our [FAQ](/handbook/legal/privacy/product-usage-events-faq/) for more information on scenarios where Snowplow Metrics are disabled on Self-Managed instances by default.

### License Sync

*Purpose*: GitLab collects certain Metrics for Self-Managed instances and Dedicated through License Sync to be able to determine if the number of users provisioned under a paid license exceeds the monetary value of the subscription. If there is a disjunction between the subscription and the number of users under a license, these Metrics are used by the GitLab Fulfillment Team as part of a monthly, quarterly or annual reconciliation process. These Metrics also allows us to determine the number of open seats under a license and assists in our analysis of renewals and licensing consolidation.

*Applicable Software*: License Sync Metrics are collected from paid Self-Managed (EE Distribution) instances and Dedicated. License Sync does not collect Metrics from free Self-Managed (CE or EE Distribution). For GitLab.com versions of the software, the GitLab Fulfillment Team uses the Subscription Data collected by Service Ping to facilitate the reconciliation review described in the preceding paragraph. Please read our [GitLab.com subscriptions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/) and [Self-managed subscriptions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/) pages for more information.

*Configuration*: License Sync collects Metrics from paid Self-Managed instances and Dedicated to activate [Cloud Licensing](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/licensing-faq/cloud-licensing/). Further, License Sync ingests these Metrics for Self-Managed and Dedicated customers and sends it to our [Customer Portal](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/customers_portal.html) for the aforementioned license management and reconciliations. Then the Metrics are sent to our data warehouse.

*Personal Data Collected*: The only personal data collected by License Sync is the name, email address, hostname and company of the individual listed on the paid Self-Managed or Dedicated license. These personal data elements are encrypted within the license key. Please read [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#subscription-data) for more details.

*Data Sharing*: License Sync Metrics are not shared with independent third-parties. License Sync, Customer Portal, and data warehouse are GitLab-controlled systems.

*Cadence*: License Sync Metrics are collected daily.

*Ownership*: License Sync is owned by the [GitLab Fulfillment Team](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/fulfillment/).

*Types of Data*: The Metrics collected include name, email, hostname and company of the individual listed on the paid Self-Managed or Dedicated license, as well as those Metrics listed [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#subscription-data).

*Opting-Out*: By default, all paid GitLab.com subscriptions on 14.1 or higher with an internet connection will have Subscription Data collected via License Sync. If a Self-Managed or Dedicated customer wishes to opt-out of License Sync, they should consult with GitLab Sales to obtain a Legacy or Offline License. For paid GitLab.com subscriptions, you cannot opt-out of Subscription Data collected via Service Ping.

## Switchboard

*Purpose*: GitLab customers using the Dedicated single tenant SaaS offering have access to a customer console called [Switchboard](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/saas-platforms/switchboard/). Switchboard is used by customer teams to maintain and configure their own Dedicated tenant. Metrics from the Switchboard application are collected to help GitLab better understand how Dedicated customers are using Switchboard. In turn, these Metrics will assist in driving further development of the Switchboard application.

*Applicable Software*: Switchboard Metrics are collected only from Dedicated users with access to the Switchboard application.

*Configuration*: Switchboard Metrics are only collected from the Switchboard application itself and not from the Dedicated tenant. Therefore, user interactions in the Dedicated tenant do not result in any data collected under this section. Please view this [high-level diagram](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/dedicated/#architecture) that demonstrates the flow of Metrics collected from the Switchboard application and sent to our data warehouse for further processing.

*Personal Data Collected*: Switchboard Metrics are initially tied to an individual user in a raw format. However, these Metrics are sent through a de-identification process and subsequently purged, meaning only pseudonymized Metrics or Metrics aggregated across an entire Switchboard customer console are delivered to our data warehouse. Pseudonymized Metrics are still considered personal data under applicable data protection laws since these Metrics are capable of re-identification. GitLab, however, does not undertake any processes to re-identify or relate the Metrics back to individual users.

*Data Sharing*: Switchboard Metrics are not shared with independent third-parties. The Switchboard application and data warehouse are GitLab-controlled systems.

*Cadence*: Switchboard Metrics are collected from GitLab.com and sent to the data warehouse contemporaneously.

*Ownership*: Switchboard Metrics are owned by the [GitLab Dedicated Group](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/) and the [Analytics Instrumentation Group](/handbook/engineering/data-engineering/analytics/monitor/analytics-instrumentation/).

*Types of Data*: A full list of the Switchboard Metrics collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/events/?serviceName=Switchboard).

*Opting-Out*: Currently, there is no mechanism for opting out of Switchboard Metrics.

## GitLab Duo (AI-Powered Features)

*Purpose*: GitLab collects [Snowplow events](/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/#snowplow) from GitLab Duo users in order for GitLab to gain insights into the success and value of certain Duo features, understand end-to-end user interaction with these features, and ensure the features are debugged and working properly. 

*Applicable Software*: GitLab Duo Metrics are collected from GitLab.com, Dedicated and Self-Managed users that have Duo licenses since GitLab Duo is a cloud-connected feature add-on.  For instances that use only self-hosted models, please see the opt-out directions at the bottom of this section.

*Configuration*:  For GitLab.com or Dedicated, first-party Duo Metrics are collected from the editor extension by our Snowplow collector and then sent to our data warehouse. For Self-Managed instances, first-party Duo Metrics are collected from the editor extension, sent to the instance, and our Snowplow collector sends the Metrics from the instance to our data warehouse.

*Personal Data Collected*: GitLab Duo Metrics may contain the personal data of individual users in a raw format. These raw Metrics, however, are sent through a pseudonymization process and subsequently purged, meaning only the pseudonymized Metrics are delivered to our data warehouse. Specifically, we pseudonymize fields such as [user_id, namespace_id, project_id and page_url](https://metrics.gitlab.com/identifiers/) to protect user privacy while still maintaining the ability to analyze usage patterns. These pseudonymized Metrics are still considered personal data under applicable data protection laws since these Metrics are capable of re-identification. GitLab, however, does not undertake any processes to re-identify or relate the Metrics back to individual users. 

*Data Sharing*: GitLab Duo Metrics are not shared with independent third-parties. All systems and software used in the collection and transfer of GitLab Duo Metrics are GitLab-controlled systems.

*Cadence*: GitLab Duo Metrics that are collected from GitLab.com, Dedicated, and Self-Managed are sent to our data warehouse contemporaneously.

*Ownership*: GitLab Duo Metrics are owned by the [Analytics Instrumentation Group](/handbook/engineering/data-engineering/analytics/monitor/analytics-instrumentation/).

*Types of Data*: A full list of the GitLab Duo Metrics collected can be viewed [here](https://metrics.gitlab.com/events/?category=duo). In addition, you can find a general overview of Duo telemetry [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/data_usage/#telemetry).

*Opting-Out*: Currently, there is no mechanism within the GitLab settings to opt-out of GitLab Duo Metrics for an entire instance or namespace. However, if you opt-out of telemetry in the extension editor, GitLab will honor that user-level opt-out across GitLab.com, Dedicated, or Self-Managed. For Self-Managed instances that only power Duo with self-hosted models, GitLab Duo Metrics may be disabled through the same in-app administrative setting used to disable all Snowplow Metrics for Self-Managed.
