## Access

We are transitioning GitLab's learning and compliance training to LevelUp, our central portal for talent enblement and on-demand learning. During this transition period, annual refresher training will be delivered through LevelUp with the exception of new hire training. New hire training will be delivered through NAVEX until we have completed our transition to LevelUp. 

All team members will receive automatic access to their assigned compliance training courses. New team members have a task in their onboarding issue to complete assigned compliance courses within 30 days of starting. 

## Courses

New hires are enrolled in the following courses on their start date:

- Ethics and Code of Conduct
- Insider Trading
- Global Data Privacy
- Team members in Finance, Legal & Corporate Affairs, Marketing, and Sales: Anti-Bribery and Corruption
- Team members employed by or working with our public sector entity: Government Contracting: Gifts, Gratuities, and Bribery

Each of these courses should take around 30 minutes or less to complete.

### Anti-Harassment

Team members are also enrolled in the following anti-harassment-related course(s) based on their role and location.

| **Role** | **Location** | **NAVEX Course** | **Approximate Duration** |
|----------|--------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Individual Contributor | Outside the US | Global Workplace Harassment | 30 minutes |
| Individual Contributor | US | The Workplace Harassment 10 course that meets your specific jurisdictional requirements | 60 minutes (exact length will vary depending location) |
| Manager | Outside the US (unless any direct reports are located in Cook County, Illinois) | Global Workplace Harassment for Managers | 30-60 minutes |
| Manager | US (and any having direct reports located in Cook County, Illinois) | Workplace Harassment 10 for Managers, designed to meet the heightened training requirements that apply to GitLab due to its business operations in various states and the City of Chicago, Illinois | 120 minutes* |
| All | Cook County, Illinois and/or having direct reports in Cook County, Illinois | Bystander Intervention | 60 minutes* |

*If you complete the course under the time required for your jurisdiction, you will be prompted to spend the remaining time reviewing the course material in order to meet location-specific requirements.

### Refresher Training and Recertification

Team members will be enrolled in refresher training on a regular basis and asked to complete a certification for certain courses (including Ethics and Code of Conduct).

## Best Practices for Using NAVEX

For the best LevelUp user experience, be aware of any special browser plug-ins, add-ons, or settings that may interfere with pop-ups. If you see a 0% progress bar during a course, note that some courses only report completion status, not ongoing progress. Use "My Learning" and/or Transcript features to verify completion and monitor your assignments. We have a dedicated Slack channel for platform technical issues - #fy26-levelup-support. Include details about any errors or issues you're experiencing. For questions about course content (not technical issues), use #compliance-training.

If you continue to experience difficulties or have questions, contact #compliance-training.
