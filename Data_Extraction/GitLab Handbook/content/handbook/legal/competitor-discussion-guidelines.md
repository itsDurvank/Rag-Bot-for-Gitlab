## Guidelines on public discussion of competitor product features

These guidelines govern how to discuss and reference competitor product features and screenshots in public issues, GitLab documentation, and other public-facing media.

## Scope

- **Applies to**: All public discussions of competitor product features and screenshots in public issues, GitLab documentation, and other public-facing forums, whether initiated by team members or community members.

- **Does not apply to**: Discussions in confidential issues, internal materials, or platforms accessible only to GitLab team members (like MURAL). For clarification on external vs. internal use, see the [External vs. Internal Use](/handbook/legal/materials-legal-review-process/#external-vs-internal-use) section of the Materials Legal Review Process.

- **Note** that the term "Screenshots" when used within these guidelines includes screenshots and screen recordings from any source, including publicly available sources (YouTube videos, websites) and directly from competitor products.

## Dos and don'ts

### Do

- Initiate and engage in general discussions about competitor product features, including analysis of advantages and disadvantages.

  *Example: "collaborate.ly's new merge commit message implementation has an interesting approach to handling conflicts. GitLab solves this differently by..."*

- Share screenshots obtained from publicly available sources (not from free trials or paid accounts) when providing illustration and commentary.

  *Example: Sharing a screenshot from a competitor's public documentation page to discuss UI differences.*

- Engage in general discussions about competitor product features in response to screenshots shared by community members.

- Include competitor screenshots in GitLab documentation for reference purposes (for example, in migration instructions, integration guidance, or CI/CD usage in third-party repositories).

  *Example: Including screenshots in migration documentation that show where to find export options in the competitor's interface.*

- Reach out to [#legal](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C78E74A6L) with any questions.

### Do not

- Share competitor screenshots without accompanying commentary or critical analysis.

  *Example: Posting a competitor's dashboard screenshot with no context or discussion.*

- Initiate, or engage in, discussions proposing plans to directly copy competitor features verbatim, with or without screenshots.

  *Example: "We should copy collaborate.ly's exact implementation of merge commit messages."*

- Share screenshots taken directly from competitor products through the use of free trials or paid accounts for competitive benchmarking.

  *Example: Taking screenshots while logged into a competitor's product during a free trial period and sharing them publicly.*

- Share screenshots that include competitor logos or third-party logos (except logos that are part of the product's user interface).

  *Example: Sharing a screenshot that shows a competitor's logo in the header or footer of their website.*
