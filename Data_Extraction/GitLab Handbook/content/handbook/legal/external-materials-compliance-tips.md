---

When developing materials for external use, follow the [SAFE Framework](/handbook/legal/safe-framework/) and the [Guidelines for Use of Third-party IP in External Materials](/handbook/legal/ip-public-materials-guidelines/) (the "**IP Guidelines**"). If you have any questions, reach out to the Legal & Corporate Affairs Team via the [#safe Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C01UZQ63WFQ).

 The tips on this page serve as a quick-reference guide, and should not be used as a substitute for reviewing and following the SAFE Framework and the IP Guidelines in full.

**Examples of common legal review feedback**

- Refer to the [Examples of common legal review feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwubBXXsacErxmrE4F_x3AOk2b6V4ZJU_tCLUgTZ1kc/preview?tab=t.0) document.

**Compliance checklist**

Before sharing materials for review, or publishing or using materials you've created, confirm the materials comply with the items in this checklist:

- All facts and statements included in the materials are true and correct, and not misleading or deceptive in any way.
- All statements of fact and assumptions are clearly referenced (giving the source name and date) from a reputable source within the collateral (e.g., Gartner, SEC filings, GitLab partner, mainstream technology publications).
- As of dates to indicate the date the information was accurate are included. (e.g., `approximately 2,375 team members as of January 31, 2025`).
- Backup materials and data verifying any express or implied claims in the materials are saved and accessible.
- There are no guarantees regarding outcomes or that the product will meet any individual's, company's, or customer's specific needs.
- Materials do not contain any unqualified superlatives or overpromotion (e.g. replace `the best` with `among the best`).
- There are no defamatory statements made about other companies, products, services, or people.
- Case studies included are accurate, not misleading, and necessary approvals for publication from the customer or partner featured are in place and documented.
- If indicated by the [Required Disclaimers guidance](/handbook/product/product-processes/product-safe-guidance/#required-disclaimers), the [appropriate roadmap disclaimer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hbf9AnFj_E5Y_Yg_WWoy_R0WJXZZLV0zWpMUHqnIs3c/edit#slide=id.ge2b39964d2_0_144) is included.
- All audio and visual content (including images, video, sounds, and music) is obtained from a permissively-licensed source, or is subject to a license permitting the proposed use.
- All content is appropriate for a professional setting and neither offensive nor misleading.
- Where [necessary](/handbook/legal/publicity-waiver-release), signed Publicity Waiver and Release agreements are in place with named individuals, and individuals appearing in audio or visual content.
- All required external approvals have been obtained prior to using an external party's materials (e.g., Gartner, Forrester, etc.).
- If the material references upcoming products, features or functionality, the appropriate disclaimer is included.
