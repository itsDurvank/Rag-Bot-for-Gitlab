### Role of Product Designers

Product Designers are assigned to a specific area of the product, known as Stage Groups, where they immerse themselves in user workflows to solve real customer problems.

They are also responsible for broader UX department efforts, such as:

- Supporting community contributions
- Contributing to the Pajamas Design System
- Reviewing other designers' work

Each designer works as a [manager of one](/handbook/values/#managers-of-one) to solve customers problems and align with the direction of the product. They collaborate with stage peers and managers to [manage their capacity](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/capacity-management) and deliver results on time. For a detailed view into how Product Designers work, review the [Product Designer workflow page](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/).

For more information on Stage Groups, team member assignments, and product direction, visit [the product category page](/handbook/product/categories/).

### Process and Design Responsibility

#### Owner of design judgment

As Product Designers, we are entrusted with the authority of **design judgment**. Our process begins with understanding the problem and prioritizing for the best user experience. When additional constraints or insights (e.g. technical considerations or marketing strategies) arise, we collaboratively evaluate and adjust our designs accordingly. We proactively communicate how these constraints impact our designs and what changes will affect the user.

In cases where our counterparts have differing opinions, we consider their perspectives but hold the final say on design decisions as we are the ultimate guardians of design judgment.

### Design Principles and Tools

Our [design principles](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/principles/) are outlined in the Pajamas Design System.

Product Designer Tools

- [UX Scorecard](/handbook/product/ux/ux-scorecards/)
- [Category Maturity Scorecard](/handbook/product/ux/category-maturity/category-maturity-scorecards/)
- [UX Issue Triage](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/engineering-productivity/issue-triage/#ux)
- [Heuristics](/handbook/product/ux/heuristics/)
- [Competitor Evaluation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/competitor-evaluations) (*GitLab Team Member access only*)
- [UX Cloud Sandbox](/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/ux-cloud-sandbox/)

Figma and Figjam are our primary design tool of choice. Refer to the [usage and access details](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/figma).

## Product Design Workflow

Product Designers adhere to the [Product Development flow](/handbook/product-development/product-development-flow/) in collaboration with stable counterparts. Key aspects include:

- [Planning and managing capacity](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/capacity-management)
- [Prioritization](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/capacity-management/#priorities)
- [Working on Issues](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#working-on-issues)
- [Design Process](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#product-design-process)
- [Partnering with UX Research](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#partnering-with-ux-researchers)
- [Partnering with Technical Writers](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#partnering-with-technical-writers)
- [Contributing to Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/get-started/contributing/)
- [Designing with AI](/handbook/product/ux/product-designer/#designing-with-ai)

New GitLab Product Designers should refer to the [Product Designer Workflow handbook page](/handbook/ux/product-design/workflow/) for a comprehensive guide to getting started.

## Product Design Management Workflow
