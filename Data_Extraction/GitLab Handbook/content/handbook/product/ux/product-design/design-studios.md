## Design Studios

Design Studios (or just Studios) are regular meetings for product designers to connect and work together. These meetings aren't limited to specific teams - any product designer can join.

They provide casual time for socializing, sharing work, getting feedback, and more. They help fill the gap between async and larger sync meetings. With just a few designers meeting together, we can build better personal and work relationships. This should also help us work better together outside these meetings.

To track issues related to these meetings, use the [`Design studios` label](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name=Design+studios).

### Background

After a successful first pilot for designers in EMEA time zones, [we expanded to more time zones](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/2500) with several volunteer hosts. We even had an [in-person Studio at Summit 2024](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/2520)! We [learned a lot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/-/issues/2538) and wrote this guide so everyone could learn about them. For more details, see the 2024-02-21 UX Showcase: [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kstErLPh2R0) and [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lJgC_Qq3K-EQLClkrvnmuXPvHi08iPHmJ-5gpl4RROo/edit#slide=id.g2b960221cc4_0_0).

## Who can join

Studios are only for Product Design individual contributors (not managers). They're meant to be a safe space where we only share materials with other product designers. We discussed including managers but were worried that fewer people would participate. Hosts are responsible for sharing relevant discussions more widely while keeping people anonymous when needed. See [issues related to the Studios](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name=Design+studios).

## How to join

As a product designer, your attendance is optional, but Studios work better when more people join, so please come if you can!

You're invited to all available Design Studios — choose the one that work best for you. They're also on the [UX calendar](/handbook/product/ux/ux-resources/#ux-department-google-calendar).

## Start a new Studio

<summary>Steps to start a new Studio</summary>

Follow these steps after getting approval:

## Measure success

We measure success in two main ways:

1. **Anytime**: Attendees can give feedback through the [anonymous survey](https://forms.gle/PzpoLQYaFwbdD2Vw6) shared on every call.
1. **Quarterly review**: We look more closely at several aspects:
   1. We encourage attendees to complete the [anonymous feedback survey](https://forms.gle/PzpoLQYaFwbdD2Vw6), and we then [review their responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rk92hwNFuu_wXJbIUeP2QtqsWqfHBdJahDkZyX54ACc/edit?usp=sharing).
   1. Attendees can join a retrospective discussion. See [all retrospective issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/18024).
   1. We report attendee satisfaction and attendance numbers in the retrospective issue.
