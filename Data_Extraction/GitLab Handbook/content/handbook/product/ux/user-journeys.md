User journey mapping at GitLab provides a strategic framework for teams to understand the complete journey of customers and GitLab users as they discover, evaluate, adopt, and integrate our DevSecOps platform. By systematically mapping these experiences:

- We identify friction points, opportunities for education, and moments that matter most to users.
- We create seamless pathways that increase first orders, accelerate successful onboarding, and strengthen long-term retention across our customer base.

## Key terminology

- **User journey:** A user journey is the complete sequence of experiences, interactions, and touchpoints that a user has with GitLab over time to accomplish specific goals or outcomes. It encompasses the user's progression through various stages and touchpoints relevant to their goals across different stages of the software development lifecycle. The specific details captured (such as emotions, pain points, or granular steps) will vary based on the elevation level of the journey map being created.

- **Golden journey:** A golden journey is the most valuable and strategically important user path through GitLab's platform that maximizes both user success and business value. It represents the ideal, high-frequency route that users take to achieve core outcomes while driving key business metrics such as activation, retention, expansion, and monetization. Golden journeys typically span multiple stages of the software development lifecycle and serve as the foundation for product strategy and cross-functional alignment.

- **Journey map:** A journey map is a visual representation and documentation of a user journey that captures the user's workflow, stages, and key opportunities across different touchpoints. The specific details captured (such as emotions, pain points, or sub-steps) will vary based on the elevation level of the journey map. It serves as a shared artifact for cross-functional teams to understand, analyze, and improve the user experience.

## Journey map elevations

Journey map elevation refers to the different levels of detail and scope at which user journeys can be mapped and analyzed, each serving different strategic and tactical purposes within the organization.

Journey map elevation levels connect and inform each other, with micro-level insights about specific interactions feeding into mid-level understanding of complete workflows, and mid-level findings informing macro-level strategic decisions.

### Macro level

- Purpose: Strategic alignment and ecosystem understanding
- Timeframe: Covers months to years capturing the full customer lifecycle from initial awareness through long-term use/advocacy
- Scope:
  - Focus on high-level phases, major milestones, and business outcomes
  - Show cross-service and cross-channel experiences
  - Include long-term emotional arc and loyalty drivers
  - Identify ecosystem-wide improvement opportunities
- Artifacts: TBD

### Mid level

- Purpose: Cross-functional alignment and end-to-end experience optimization
- Timeframe: Covers days to weeks for a specific user goal or service experience
- Scope:
  - Focus on specific user scenario from start to finish
  - Include detailed pain points and emotional journey
  - Show specific touchpoints and channels
  - Identify tactical improvement opportunities
- Artifacts: TBD

### Micro level

- Purpose: Interaction optimization and usability improvement
- Timeframe: Covers minutes to hours for specific task completion
- Scope:
  - Focus on granular user flows and micro-interactions
  - Include detailed interface elements and user actions
  - Show moment-by-moment emotions and friction points
  - Identify specific UI/UX improvements and metrics
- Artifacts: TBD
