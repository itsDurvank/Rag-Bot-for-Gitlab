This is an informational page for the Zendesk emails. We are aiming to no longer user these, so all information within should never be used in a Zendesk instance unless explicitly part of a deployment process.

## What are Zendesk emails

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408888639258-A-complete-guide-to-understanding-email-in-Zendesk-Part-1-How-the-email-channel-works):

> Email is one way that end-users can submit tickets to Zendesk Support and have conversations with agents to resolve their issues.

Basically, Zendesk emails enable an end-user to email an address and have a ticket created from it. Usage of this varies widely from instance to instance.
