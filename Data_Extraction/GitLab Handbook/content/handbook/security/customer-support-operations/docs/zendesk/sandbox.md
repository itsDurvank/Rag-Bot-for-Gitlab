## What is the Zendesk Sandbox

The Zendesk Sandbox is a replica Zendesk instance you can use to test, learn, replicate, etc. in an environment that is separated from production instances.

We utilize the Zendesk Sandbox in all our change management processes. This allows us a safe and secure place to test changes/updates/etc. so we can ensure the implementations we push into production are both stable and well vetted.

## Where are the sandboxes?

You can locate the sandboxes via:

- [Global](https://gitlab1707170878.zendesk.com/agent/)
- [US Federal](https://gitlabfederalsupport1585318082.zendesk.com/agent)

## How to access the Zendesk Sandbox

We have many, many test users with login credentials you can use in the sandbox. You can locate the information for them via the [Zendesk Sandbox Test Orgs and Users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6lJ3AUS4EYqoBYzAdExp4v1dkzOb3GWKaMIoZikjts/edit?usp=sharing) Google sheet (internal only).

If for some reason the users there will not work in your case, please contact the Fullstack Engineer for Support Operations.
