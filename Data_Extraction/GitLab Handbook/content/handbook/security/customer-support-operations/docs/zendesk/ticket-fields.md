## What are ticket fields

Ticket fields are the individual components that make up a ticket form. They can be customized to ask for specific information and help generate ticket metadata.

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886739098-About-ticket-fields), there are two types of ticket fields:

> - Standard ticket fields - predefined fields that agents see in a ticket. Additional standard fields are added to the ticket page when you activate additional Zendesk Support features, such as ticket sharing. You can deactivate and reactivate some (but not all) of the standard fields.
See the [complete list of standard ticket fields](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886739098-About-ticket-fields#topic_drw_ft1_3nb).
> - Custom ticket fields - created in addition to standard ticket fields to gather additional information from the person who is requesting support. For example, you may add a custom field prompting them to select a product name or model number.
See the [complete list of custom ticket field types](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408838961562).
