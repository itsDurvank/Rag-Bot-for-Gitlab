## Overview

Lumos is our access review platform. User access reviews are critical to ensuring GitLab systems are being accessed appropriately, securely, and compliantly. If you are a DRI for an app, technical owner, or business owner, you may be assigned access review tasks from Lumos. If you are the direct manager of a team member who manages an app, you may also receive user access review assignments for those you manage.

Before getting started in Lumos, please read the [Access Review Procedure](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-compliance/access-reviews/). When an access review is assigned, Lumos will reach out via email and Slack with the app name and permissions being reviewed in the title of the access review.

## Access Review Message Template
