## Summary

GitLab has a highly technical workforce outside of the Product/Engineering divisions who are looking to make direct product contributions. This document details a process on how to do this work so we can deliver results for customers. 

## Process

### Project Phases

#### 1. Identify Core Team and Objective 

* At a minimum, require a Product Manager, Engineering Manager or Tech Lead, and a Receiving Team(s) 

  * **Creators** 
    * **PI** = Product/ Project Initiator (Within the Product division) 
      * Collaborate with non Prod/Eng division counterparts 
      * Provides the objectives to be met 
      * Owns the feature vision and requirements 
      * Has final sign-off authority on completed feature 
    * **EM** = Engineering Manager/ Tech Lead (This will most likely include a Project/Product manager outside the Prod/Eng division) 
      * Responsible for building the feature according to PI and RT requirements 
      * Manages the development lifecycle (design through handoff) 
  * **Receivers** 
    * **RT** = Receiving Team(s) (Within the Engineering division) 
      * Vets handoff information for readability and completeness 
      * Will ultimately own the feature long-term with the RPM 
      * Provides input during development 
      * Takes over engineering ownership after handoff 
    * **RPM** = Receiving Product/ Project Manager (Within the Product division) 
      * May be the same as the PI 
      * Will ultimately own the feature long-term with the RT 
      * Provides input during development 
      * Takes over product/ project ownership after handoff 

#### 2. Project Scope and Objectives 

* **PI** defines the goal behavior and desired business outcomes 
* **PI + EM** identify whatâ€™s in and out of scope 
* **EM** shares the implementation plan and design proposal for the **RT** 
* **EM** provides timelines for development and handoff negotiated 
* **RT, RPM, EM+PI** document review/approval by leadership of both teams on maintenance/feature_category association 
* **PI + EM** define key deliverables, objectives, and dependencies 
* Ends with documentation of project goal(s) with sign-off from **EM, PI, and RT** 

#### 3. Develop the Project Plan 

* **PI + EM** work together to document the use cases and workflows 
* **EM** decompose functionality into Milestones, Epics, and Issues 
* **PI + EM** work together to coordinate dependencies across orgs (e.g., APIs, data access, infrastructure) 
* **EM** documents the test plan, rollout, and deployment 
* **EM** estimate resources, budget, and timelines when required 
* **EM** plan for Risks and provides mitigation strategies (Security Review) 
* Ends with Milestones populated with the Issues/ Epics that are part of the Internal Co-Create initiative 

#### 4. Execute the Project Plan 

* **EM** reports project statuses and blockers according to standards set for all involved stakeholders 
* **EM** works with **RT + RPM** to allocate capacity 
* **PI + EM + RT + RPM** attend demos at end of each Milestone 
* **PI + EM** provide timely async feedback weekly 
* **EM** deploys the deliverables internally and then to external users 
  * New Services follow the documentation for Production Readiness Review 
  * Monolith Services follow standard MR procedures 
* Ends with the code deployed to Live 

#### 5. Delivery and Handoff 

* **EM** complete any Feature Flags and obvious Tech Debt prior to handover 
* **EM** captures lessons learned from the project 
* **EM** provide documentation for seamless and easy handoff to **RT + RPM** 
* **RT + RPM** gains competency of the deliverables before accepting ownership 
  * Documentation 
  * Knowledge Transfer Syncs 
  * Recordings of workflow and testing 
  * Lunch-and-Learn Sessions 
  * Demos 
* **RT + RPM** responsible for monitoring and iterating on deliverables after acceptance 
* Ends with **RT + RPM** signing off on receipt of the deliverables
