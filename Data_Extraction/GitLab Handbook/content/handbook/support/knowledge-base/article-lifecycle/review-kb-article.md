- Articles need to be Reviewed for Technical Accuracy before they are consumed by Customers (or Support).
- Technical Reviewers are assigned across the [Product Features and Geo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CIIVup-tS5HdLyl0wInf-2m50AptauyhG-ZW5uhs-I/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## Reviewing an article

When an article needs to be reviewed, it should be assigned to a Technical Reviewer.

Technical Reviewers can find content needing review by going to the [Manage Articles section](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/knowledge/lists/default/) within ZenDesk.

1. Select an article for review.
    - Articles assigned to you will appear under the **Tasks > Assigned to me** section.
    - All articles awaiting review appear under **Review status > Awaiting review**. You can assign an article with an empty "Assigned to" column to yourself if you are reviewing it.
1. If article was assigned to you, hover over your icon in the article to review any notes from the author.
1. Review the article for technical accuracy and make changes. Work with the author if you are unsure of content. You can share a [link to your revisions](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829321498-Viewing-article-revisions-and-restoring-a-previous-version#topic_whs_hmr_t1b) in the history.
1. Review and save appropriate Section, Labels and Content tags under "Placement". For external facing articles, ensure the audience is “Visible To Everyone”
