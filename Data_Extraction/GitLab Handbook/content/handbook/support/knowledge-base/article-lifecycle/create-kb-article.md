Knowledge Base articles can be created within Zendesk. All Support Engineers should have the ability to create and update knowledge articles.

Articles can be created directly from a Support Ticket or directly in the Knowledge Center.

## Creating an article from a ticket

1. Expand the "Knowledge" panel (open book icon) on the right-hand side of the ticket.
1. Search for similar content using the magnifying glass.
1. If no article exists, select **the plus sign (+) > Create Article**.
1. Choose one of the available article templates. This will redirect you to a new article in the Knowledge Center.
1. [Add article content](./create-kb-article/#adding-article-content).

## Creating an article from the Knowledge Center

**Limitation**: This option does not allow you to select a template when creating the article.

1. Articles can be added from [knowledge management](https://gitlab.zendesk.com/knowledge/lists/default) or the [help center](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us).
1. Search for similar content first. If an article already exists, review the article and make updates if needed.
1. If no article exists, from the top-left corner, select **the Add drop-down > Article**. This will redirect you to a blank article page.
1. No template is applied. You must manually apply a template by:

    - Copying the Template from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hpHAB51x49bRS1tfUqxiQ56UnlITtFHR).
    - Copying another article with the same template and replacing the details.

1. [Add article content](./create-kb-article/#adding-article-content).

## Updating an article

1. Open the article to be updated in Zendesk.
1. If viewing the article in the help center, select "Edit article" from the top left corner.
1. If viewing the article from knowledge management, you will already be on the edit page.
1. Make your changes.
1. When the article is ready to publish, [submit the article for review](./create-kb-article/#submitting-article-for-review).

## Adding article content

1. Add the title of the article by selecting the 'pencil icon' next to the Title.
1. Duplicate that title below in the content of the article (this is a known bug).
1. Fill in the necessary information based on the template and style guide.
1. **Optionally** use the "Preview" button in the bottom left corner to preview how the article will appear when published.
1. Save the article by clicking "Save".
1. While working on the article content, keep that status as "In progress".
1. When the article is ready to publish, [submit the article for review](./create-kb-article/#submitting-article-for-review).

## Submitting article for review

Once you believe the content is ready to be published, it must undergo review.

1. [Assign a reviewer](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822348186-Assigning-or-reassigning-articles-with-Team-Publishing#topic_ftt_d3c_2db) to the article based on the [listed knowledge champions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CIIVup-tS5HdLyl0wInf-2m50AptauyhG-ZW5uhs-I/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
1. In the comment box "What is the required update?" include:
    - If this is a new article or an update.
    - If updating an article, note what changed.
    - Relevant links for extra context on the article such as Zendeks tickets, slack threads, or requests for help.
1. Update the article status from "In progress" to "Awaiting review".
