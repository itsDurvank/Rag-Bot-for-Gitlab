Known Issues:

- In ZenDesk there a popup that states "Discover the new writing experience'. To stop this pop up, use the blue button on the bottom that says "Take a Tour". Its a few clicks, and the PopUp will go away. 
- Title must be repeated in the title field and in the article content.

- We do not yet have a full list of [Technical Reviewers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CIIVup-tS5HdLyl0wInf-2m50AptauyhG-ZW5uhs-I/edit?gid=0#gid=0). If you find a gap (and dont know who to assign) please assign to  Kirsty Allen and the article will be assigned to someone to help.
