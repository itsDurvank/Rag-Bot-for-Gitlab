title: Knowledge Base Workflow
description: This section is designed to help you understand the Knowledge Article Workflow
---


The Knowledge Workflow is the process of how information flows through - from creation to publish.  We capture knowledge, we then create the knowledge, the knowledge gets reviweed, organized, categorized, and then published . The Goal is to create a smooth, efficient flow where valuable knowledge is used by all and not lost (or trapped in someones head). Having the Knowledge workflow helps us to move the Knowledge process easily and efficiently. 

**Create a Knowledge article**

- Draft article is created (using a template)
- Knowledge Article is **in Progress**
- The Knowledge Team then reviews the article for accuracy. (Is the formatting correct, are there any spelling errors, do the links work)
- The article is then ready to be "Reviewed" by a "Technical Reviewer". 
- The article is Published

Note: 

- When Creating the knowledge article it should always be in **In Progress** Status. 
- **Ready for Review** status will be used when assigning to a Technical Reviewer
- **Ready to Publish** status will ONLY be used for articles that are to be reviewed and ready to be published on a specific date (Example: articles set for product releases)

**Modify a Knowledge article**

- Article is in Edit status (draft)
- Knowledge Article is **in Progress**
- Save the article 
- The article is then ready to be "Reviewed" by a "Technical Reviewer" (only if major changes. Minor changes it can be Republished)
- The article is Published

Note: 

- When Modifying the knowledge article the knowledge article goes back to "Draft". The Current version of the article will remain active on the page.  When the draft is published with udpates, it will update the page.

**Approving and Publishing a Knowledge article**

- Article is "Awaiting Review" or "Ready to Publish" status.
- Technical review must e done on the aticle
- If Changes need to be made, use the **Assign to** (Round Circle icon near the title). Add comments and assign to the author to make changes.
- Save the article 
- If the article is ready to publish, choose the "Publish" button. (Use the down arrow next to the Save button)
- The article is Published

Note: 

- if comments need to be made to the Author, use the Assign to Button (next to the Title)
- If the article is approved and ready to publish, make sure the article (Placement Section) is updated. See the Publishing Training for more help.
