Think about who the intended audience is, for the information. What is the purpose of the information? Can it be easily accessible to a customer? How often is it updated?

As a Best practice: Knowledge articles are more concise, easy to read, targeted for quick answers, solutions to common questions. Create knowledge articles that can help customers solve issues / problems. Create knowledge articles that are FAQs. Common questions that can be addressed/answered. Create knowledge articles that are frequently updated Create knowledge articles that can be easily accessed by customers (Searchable)

Best Practices:

- Use GitLab Terminology Consistently (Naming Structure).

    **Note**: If customer facing, make sure they can access any links that are within the article. If they cannot, do not add it.
- Categorize articles appropriately. This helps with search!
- Keep articles updated (review). If you find an article that could use more information, updatesâ€¦ do it! We all can contribute to knowledge!
- Titles of articles need to be Specific (Using key words to help be descriptive). Titles should not be log.
