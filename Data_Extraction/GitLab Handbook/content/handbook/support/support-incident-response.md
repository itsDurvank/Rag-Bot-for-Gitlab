## Support Incident Response Framework

Support Engineers regularly encounter customer-facing incidents that require rapid, coordinated responses while maintaining technical excellence. The Support Incident Response Framework provides structure for these critical moments, helping us balance customer advocacy with effective problem-solving. It provides a structured approach that complements broader organisational incident processes while focusing on the unique requirements of customer advocacy and technical problem-solving in support contexts.

The framework delivers practical benefits through clear processes, defined roles, and systematic knowledge sharing. By transforming individual experiences into team wisdom, it reduces cognitive load during stressful situations and improves our coordination. This ultimately leads to faster resolutions for our customers while supporting our professional growth as Support Engineers.

If you are seeking information to help GitLab ensure incidents are reported, investigated and handled, you might be looking for the [Incident Response Guidance](/handbook/security/product-security/vulnerability-management/incident-response-guidance/).

If an incident requires a non-standard workflow or communication from Support, create the [Support Response issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/Support%20Response.md) if this has not yet been done.

If you are looking for details about being on-call in Support, you might find what you need here: [GitLab Support On-Call Guide](/handbook/support/on-call.md)

## Working Principles

Working principles are behaviors that empower team members to carry out incident response work in alignment with the needs of our customers and our wider business Incident Response. They help illustrate what applying GitLab's core values and operating principles to your work as a Support Engineering Incident Responder will look like. These working principles are complementary to, and should be subordinate to, GitLab's core values and operating principles. In case of a conflict between the two, please create an MR to propose a change to or removal of the working principles.

### Customer-First Response

Incident decisions prioritize customer impact above technical considerations. Customer experience metrics serve as primary success indicators. Response strategies target minimal workflow disruption and fastest path to resolution. Resource allocation focuses on customer-impacting components first.

### Clear Accountability

Incidents operate with defined RACI matrices and explicit role assignments. Decision authority follows documented hierarchies to prevent ambiguity. Escalation thresholds trigger specific notification protocols. Critical path tasks maintain designated owners throughout incident lifecycle.

### Continuous Improvement

Incidents generate standardized postmortem analysis with tracked action items. Process reviews occur at scheduled intervals with defined completion criteria. Performance metrics drive framework enhancements through data validation. Process changes undergo controlled testing before full implementation.

## Incident Response Guidance

This Support Incident Response Framework is designed to complement existing organisational security and infrastructure incident response processes and should branch off established organisational workflows defined in the [Incident Response Guidance](/handbook/security/product-security/vulnerability-management/incident-response-guidance/).

As improvement efforts progress across the organisation, any content that appears duplicated between the Support Incident Response Framework and other incident frameworks will be identified. When duplication is detected, please create a Merge Request (MR) to remove the duplicated content from this framework and integrate it into the wider organisational incident framework.

This consolidation effort aims to create a unified approach to incident management while preserving the specialised workflows needed for customer-facing Support incidents. The Support Incident Response Framework will evolve accordingly, with emphasis on the unique aspects of customer support during incidents rather than replicating general incident procedures.

If you notice areas of duplication or opportunities for integration, please create an issue or MR in the appropriate project to help facilitate this alignment work.

## Key Roles and Their Responsibilities

The Role Structure and Responsibilities component defines who does what during customer-impacting incidents, establishing clear lines of authority, communication paths, and accountabilities.

Clearly defining these roles, responsibilities, and interfaces, eliminates confusion during critical incidents and high-pressure situations, ensures comprehensive coverage of all necessary functions, and provides a foundation for continuous improvement in our incident response.
