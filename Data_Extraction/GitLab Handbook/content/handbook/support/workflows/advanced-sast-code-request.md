For requests concerning the source code of LGPL-licensed components in GitLab Advanced SAST, use the **Advanced SAST App** in Zendesk. The app automates the process and guides you until a legal issue is created.

Once a legal issue is created, Dev Pulse is activated on the ticket (treating it as a RFH). The ticket will remain on-hold until the legal issue is updated, at which point you will be instructed what to say/do by our legal team.

If the issue requires additional communication, use the `General::Waiting on RFH` macro to re-activate Dev Pulse.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions as you work on the ticket, please Cc Jason Colyer on the ticket and add an internal note about the issue/question.
