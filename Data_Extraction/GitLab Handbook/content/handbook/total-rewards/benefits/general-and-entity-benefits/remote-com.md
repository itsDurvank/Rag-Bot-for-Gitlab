Brazil has specific requirements that govern statutory leave to remain compliant. For reference, after 12 months of service, you are entitled to 30 calendar days of paid time off. Team members are also eligible for [GitLab's paid time off policy](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#paid-time-off). If the time off taken falls under the requirements for statutory time then the time off will automatically be deducted from the statutory allowance first (you may see this reflected as "dummy days" on your pay slip).
If the time off does not fall under the requirements it will be used as Flex Time Off, then once you have exhausted the full statutory leave allowance all ongoing time off will be Flex Time Off per GitLab policy.

Please keep the below in mind before [submitting your time off request via Workday or the Workday Slack App](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#communicating-your-time-off).

- Vacations earned must be taken during the concession period and cannot be accumulated or carried over to the following year.
- Team members are required to submit their time off request with at least 30 days’ notice. Although, we recommend team members submit their time off request 45 days in advance (this is to ensure accuracy and reporting for statutory compliance).

Team members in Denmark can also access the [public healthcare system](https://healthcaredenmark.dk/). This healthcare system covers all the team members and their family members.

Team members can expense up to $250 for eye examination and glasses if they require corrective eyeware to work at a computer screen for extended periods of time. (Login required to see [policy](https://support.remote.com/hc/en-us/articles/20050865403149-Screen-Work-Eye-Examination))

### Eye Examination and Corrective Lenses

Team Members who spend a significant portion of their working hours in front of a screen are entitled to receive an eye and vision examination. This examination should be conducted by either an optician or an ophthalmologist. The employer is responsible for covering the cost of this examination, and every effort should be made to schedule it during regular working hours.

In cases where the Team Member requires corrective eyewear, the employer is obligated to provide, at a minimum, one standard frame with lenses or standard contact lenses at no expense to the Team Member.

Remote has implemented a self-service model to facilitate this process, with a budget allocation of $250 USD to cover frame with lenses or standard contact lenses. This approach allows employees to independently arrange their eye examinations, purchase necessary eyeglasses, and then submit their expenses for reimbursement through the Remote platform.

Remote will directly contribute to a Group Pension Plan (Soderberg & Partners). The team member will contribute 4% of the monthly base salary, with the Employer contributing 8% of the team members monthly base salary.

The contribution to the pension savings plan will be paid directly into the pension plan in conjunction with the Employer’s payment of the monthly salary to the team member.

### Life Insurance

GitLab does not plan to offer life insurance at this time as team members can access the benefits from Social insurance system if they get ill, injured or have a disability. The [GitLab Life Insurance plan](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#life-insurance) still applies.

- [Allianz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMw61FsriqRPfcFRQ-mzQsu6HF03IUFB/view)

### Pension

The Swedish Pension is with Nordnet Hållbar/SPP

This plan has required enrollment for all employees. There is no opt-out option.

*Contribution rates are:*

- Pensionable Salary between 0 and 7.5 x the [Income Base Amount (IBA*)](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1130&langId=en&intPageId=4814#:~:text=The%20income%20base%20amount%20is,is%20also%20a%20lower%20limit.) = 4.5% On Pensionable Salary between 7.5 and 30 x the IBA = 30% No contributions are payable on Pensionable Salary above 30 x the IBA.
- The company pays all the contributions and no contributions are required from employees.
- Pensionable salary is defined as Basic Salary only.
- Membership of the pension scheme is open to employees aged 18 to 65.

Example for 2024 Income Base Amount:

An employee with an annual salary of 800 000 SEK.

- the 2024 IBA (income base amount) is 76 200 SEK. This means that 7,5 IBA x 76 200 is= 571 500
- Up to a salary of 571 500 the employee has 4,5% contribution (coming from the employer), and above 571 500 (up to 800 000) they have a 30% contribution. There is also a roof of 30% IBA, so if an employee has an annual salary over 30 IBA (2 286 000 SEK), there would be no contribution beyond that level.
To the top of that amount, 24,26% taxes should be added.

### Life Insurance
