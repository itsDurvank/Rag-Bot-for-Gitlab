## Life at GitLab

At GitLab, our mission is simple: to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. Our platform doesn’t just bring people together—it unites teams and organizations, breaking down barriers and redefining what’s possible in software development.

Here, you’re not just contributing to a tool, you’re shaping the future of secure, scalable software delivery. Our high-performance culture values collaboration, ownership, and impact, accelerating careers while driving global innovation.
This is more than a job, it’s your opportunity to build something that matters.

### Everyone can contribute

Our size and [our mission](/handbook/company/mission/#mission) (enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world.) mean that our team members can — and are expected to — make an impact across the company.

Because we all use our product internally, you don't have to be a developer to learn to collaborate in the GitLab tool.
From your very first week, no matter your role, you'll gain the technical skills needed to access, question, and contribute to projects far beyond your job description.

This unique approach works because we're a team of helpful, passionate people who want to see each other, the company, and the broader GitLab community succeed.
We learn from each other, challenge each other, and thank each other.

Come prepared to do meaningful work that will help shape the future of the company.

While the opportunities to contribute are boundless in a growing organization like GitLab, they may not be clearly defined.
You'll need to think creatively, speak up to see how you can help, and be willing to try something new.

### Freedom to iterate

At GitLab, our [value of iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) has a unique impact on the way we operate and get things done.

Working this way means our team members are expected to quickly deliver the minimal valuable change in their work instead of waiting to produce a polished, completed product.

While this can be a challenging practice to adopt at first, it's liberating to be able to make mistakes, get feedback quickly, and course correct to reach a better outcome, faster.

As our company and the industry continue to grow, you'll have the freedom to change and constantly evolve everything from your schedule and your workspace to your job description and your skills.

## Culture at GitLab

Culture at GitLab is composed of three things.

1. [GitLab Values](/handbook/values/)
1. Camaraderie (mutual trust and friendship). This is created and maintained by [informal communication](all-remote/informal-communication/). We also build trust by [effectively collaborating](/handbook/values/#dont-let-each-other-fail) with others.
1. Work style (how we work). This is defined and articulated in our [communication guide](/handbook/communication/) and [handbook usage guide](/handbook/about/handbook-usage/).
