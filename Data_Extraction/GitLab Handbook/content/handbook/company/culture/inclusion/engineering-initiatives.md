This page is in [draft](/handbook/values/#everything-is-in-draft). We are working to build out this page and gather all the running initiatives/partnerships in Engineering.

## Engineering Inclusion and Accessibility Initiatives

At GitLab, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging is infused into our company culture, from our [values](/handbook/values/) to our [all-remote way of working](/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/).
Engineering partners closely with our [Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging](/handbook/company/culture/inclusion/) team to ensure we're building a diverse and inclusive workforce around the globe as the company continues to grow.

## Overview

At GitLab, fostering an inclusive and accessible engineering environment is integral to our mission of enabling everyone to contribute. By embedding accessibility and inclusive practices into our engineering processes, we enhance innovation, improve product quality, and meet the diverse needs of our global user base.

## Strategic Focus Areas

Our engineering DIB strategy aligns with GitLab's A.D.A.P.T model while focusing on three key pillars:

### 1. DNA (Disability, Neurodiversity, and Accessibility) Integration

At GitLab, DNA aims to integrate disability, neurodiversity, and accessibility into all aspects of the company - from product design to talent acquisition, team member education, and culture through TMRG engagement. Using the ARISE (link to follow) framework transforms GitLab's DNA strategy into actionable initiatives

**Key Goals:**

- Integrate Accessibility in Communications and Product Strategy
- Implement Accessibility Technologies
- Strengthen People & Talent Processes
- Develop Allyship through Education
- Enhance TMRG Engagement and Allyship

### 2. Global Inclusion and Regional Initiatives

GitLab's global DIB strategy focuses on creating an inclusive environment that spans our worldwide workforce. Our regional initiatives are tailored to address specific needs across APAC-J, EMEA, and the Americas, with particular emphasis on expanding representation and developing inclusive leadership. Key priorities include launching our comprehensive accessibility strategy and enhancing our Team Member Resource Groups (TMRGs) to better support our global team members. We're also focused on strengthening regional programs that reflect local needs while maintaining alignment with our global objectives.

### 3. Career Development

GitLab's career development strategy focuses on creating pathways for advancement across all levels of the organization. We're emphasizing inclusive leadership development through training programs and coaching, while expanding mentorship opportunities for underrepresented groups. Additionally, we're working to ensure our talent management processes support career progression through systematic audits and clear development frameworks.
