## Center of Excellence

To drive efficiencies throughout GitLab’s Sales Organization while contributing to the broader GTM motion, an SA Center of Excellence will allow the team to expand GitLab’s revenue 
opportunities.  The team would be responsible for the following items, pulled in by other teams (e.g., CS, Field CTO, Field Enablement).

- [Demo Architecture](./demo-architecture/)
- Business Value Services - driving our [business value consulting](../sa-practices/business-value-consulting/) efforts.
- Subject Matter Experts

_All of the SMEs within the COE above will be 100% aligned to their respective areas of expertise. All Field SME Representatives are used to supplement these SME team members dedicated to their 
respective subject matter areas of expertise._
