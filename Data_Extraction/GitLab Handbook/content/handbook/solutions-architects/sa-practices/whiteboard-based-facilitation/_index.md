## Why Use a Whiteboard?

Whiteboards are a powerful facilitation tool that drives active participation from the audience and captures ideas/feedback visually in real-time. They allow for a more natural flow of conversation, unlike slideshows which present static, prepared content. The whiteboard becomes a shared artifact that provides immediate value to participants, creates a shared understanding between all parties, and builds trust between participants. This page provides whiteboard templates that can be immediately applied to regular SA practices.

### Primary Objectives

1. Whiteboarding should facilitate better the discovery of:
    1. Customer's initiatives and challenges
    1. Customer's toolchain
    1. Customer's current state and workflows
    1. Customer's pain points and bottlenecks
    1. Key teams/personas involved

### Available Templates
