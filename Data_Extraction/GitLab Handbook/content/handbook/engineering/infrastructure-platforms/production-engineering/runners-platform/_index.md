## Mission

The Runners Platform team is responsible for developing and maintaining a fully operational, manageable, and maintainable Runners offering across all GitLab platforms. We focus on the core technology underpinning GitLab's runner infrastructure, including hosted runners for GitLab.com, Hosted runners for Dedicated, while ensuring compatibility with the [Cells](/handbook/engineering/architecture/design-documents/cells/infrastructure/runner/) architecture.

Our mission is to provide an operational foundation with appropriate management interfaces and controls that enable reliable, scalable CI/CD execution while collaborating closely with the Runners application team to deliver features essential for smooth operations and successful product launches.

## Vision

**"A single Runner Platform for our SaaS Platforms"**

We envision a unified, robust runners platform that delivers consistent, reliable performance across GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated. Our platform will provide the operational excellence needed to support GitLab's growing CI/CD demands while enabling cost-efficient scaling and comprehensive observability. We aim to eliminate operational silos and create a foundation that allows product teams to focus on user-facing features while we ensure the underlying infrastructure is production-ready, scalable, and maintainable.

## Ownership and Responsibilities

The Runners Platform team focuses on:

1. Creating systems for managing and scaling the GitLab-hosted runners infrastructure
2. Creating systems to optimize runner performance and resource utilization
3. Building platform-level enhancements to improve runner service reliability and availability
4. Collaborating with product teams to ensure runner features meet operational and production readiness requirements
5. Developing tooling and automation for runner management and monitoring

## Collaboration Model

We work in close partnership with the Verify:Runners team, where:

- **Runners Platform team** provides the management interfaces and infrastructure foundation
- **Verify:Runners team** focuses on product offerings and determines how to best utilize the platform capabilities
- Both teams collaborate to ensure features are stable, reliable, and production-ready
