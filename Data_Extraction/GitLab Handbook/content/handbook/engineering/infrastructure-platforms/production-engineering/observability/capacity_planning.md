title: "Capacity Planning"
---

We maintain and improve the Capacity Planning process that is described [in the Infrastructure Handbook](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/capacity-planning/). This is a controlled activity covered by SOC 2. Please see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/sec-compliance/observation-management/-/issues/604) for further details

The goal of this process is to predict and prevent saturation incidents on GitLab.com.

Issues are kept in the [capacity planning issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/capacity-planning-trackers/gitlab-com/-/issues). Where an issue is needed to improve metrics to support this process, we raise an issue in the [Scalability group tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues) with the label of `Saturation Metrics`.

Please see the [docs-hub on Capacity Planning](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/observability/docs-hub/capacity-planning/introduction/) for more information on the forecasting tool we develop and use.

## Triage Duties

The triage duties docs have been moved to the Observability team's
[docs-hub](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-infra/observability/docs-hub/capacity-planning/triage-duties).
