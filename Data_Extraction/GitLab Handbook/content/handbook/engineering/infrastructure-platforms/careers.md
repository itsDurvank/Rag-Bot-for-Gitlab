Engineers within the Infrastructure Platforms department 

## Career growth within Infrastructure Platforms

Infrastructure Platforms follows the [Engineering department approach to career growth](/handbook/engineering/careers/) with [department-specific exectations for each job level](/handbook/engineering/careers/matrix/infrastructure/)

It's important for you to take an active role in shaping your career path. Consider having open conversations with your manager about your professional goals and aspirations. These discussions can help ensure you're both aligned on your development priorities and can work together to create opportunities that support your growth.

### Talent Assessment

* The annual company [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) event provides another opportunity to gain insight on progress towards both near-term and longer, career goals.

## Interning with Infrastructure Platforms

Cross reference for [Internship for Learning](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/internship-for-learning/)

There is a reasonable amount of interest to intern with Infrastructure so we wanted to put a brief landing section in the handbook.  If you are interested in interning with Infrastructure Platforms, we would ask that you talk to your current manager and create an issue per the mentioned process.  This can help us track who is helping on what and what they would like to learn. One note, in some cases, you may need to submit access-requests to get access to certain systems to help with work.

Don't know what to learn? Check out the [SRE I](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SRE%20Introduction.md) and the [SRE II](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/SRE%20II.md) Training Modules, these cover a range of topics related to how we do Reliability Engineering at GitLab. It is recommended that you come to your internship prepared, and by completing both modules, you'll ensure a richer internship experience as you'll make the best use of your time during your internship with an extra focus on more advanced topics.

Additionally, we have a broad set of technical skills listed in the [job description for SRE](/job-families/engineering/infrastructure/site-reliability-engineer/), if you are looking for ideas on what to learn, set up a coffee chat with a team member or one of the managers.

If you're interested in learning more about SREs in general, you may wish to read Alice Goldfuss's blog post, "[How to Get Into SRE](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/how-to-get-into-sre/)." This blog post is an overview of all sorts of SRE related things, some of which may not be in use here at GitLab. However, it can be a valuable tool to learn more about SREs in general, and it links to many resources that you can use to learn more about a variety of SRE related topics.

Specific ways to work in the internship:

1. Pair up with an engineer on a particular issue or for our project work.
2. Shadow the On-Call in your similar timezone for 2 weeks
3. Shadow the Delivery team to learn more about how we release to GitLab.com
