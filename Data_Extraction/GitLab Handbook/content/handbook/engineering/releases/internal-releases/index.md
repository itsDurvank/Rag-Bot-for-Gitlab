## Internal release overview

Internal Releases are private releases of GitLab for our single-tenant SaaS instances. They allow us to remediate
high-severity issues on Dedicated instances:

* As quickly and efficiently as on GitLab.com
  ([SLA driven](/handbook/security/product-security/vulnerability-management/sla/#vulnerability-management-slas-and-labels))
* Without version skips in the public packages
* Without disclosing vulnerabilities before a public patch release

Internal releases are performed according to a specific criteria:

* Addressed [critical (S1)](/handbook/security/product-security/vulnerability-management/sla/#vulnerability-management-slas-and-labels)
  fixes (bug or security vulnerability) that impact GitLab Dedicated availability: Security or bug fixes
  1. **Security vulnerability**: The SIRT team investigates a vulnerability and deems the issue to be of high
   severity.
  2. **Critical bug**: The Dedicated team reports a high-severity issue causing a performance degradation.
* Target the current minus one (N-1) and current minus two (N-2) GitLab versions
* Deliver fixes through a private channel before public disclosure

If youâ€™re a GitLab engineer looking to fix a high-severity via an internal release, please follow the steps on the
[internal release runbook for GitLab engineers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/internal-releases/engineers.md?ref_type=heads).

## Internal release process

The end-to-end internal release process consists of the following stages:

An internal release has the following phases:

1. **Detect**: A high-severity issue (S1) impacting GitLab Dedicated availability is identified.
   * Security vulnerability: The SIRT team investigates the vulnerability and deems the issue to be of a high
     severity.
   * Critical bug: The Dedicated team reports a high-severity issue causing a performance degradation.

2. **Prepare**: The first step in the internal release process, when a release issue is created and stakeholders,
   including the [GitLab Dedicated Group](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated) are notified.

3. **GitLab.com remediation**:
   * The group relevant to the vulnerability/bug prepares the security fix on the GitLab security repositories.
   * Release managers merge the fix to the GitLab default branch.
   * The high-severity fix is deployed to GitLab multi-tenant production environment (GitLab.com).
   * In case of a vulnerability, the [AppSec team](/handbook/security/product-security/application-security/#contacting-us)
     verifies that the vulnerability/bug has been remediated on GitLab.com.

4. **Backports**: Security merge requests targeting N-1 and N-2 stable branches are prepared by the relevant group
   associated with the vulnerability/bug.
   * Engineers ensure the backports are ready to be merged (approvals, green pipelines, etc).
   * Once the backports are ready to be merged, release managers merge them into the stable branches.

5. **Release**: The internal CNG images and Omnibus packages are built and uploaded to the pre-release channel.

6. **Final Steps**: Roll out the internal release packages to GitLab single-tenant SaaS instances.
   * The GitLab Dedicated Group is notified.
   * A [Dedicated emergency maintenance](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/dedicated/maintenance/#emergency-maintenance) process
     starts.
