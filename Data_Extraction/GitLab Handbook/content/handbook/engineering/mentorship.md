## Mentorship, Coaching and Engineering Programs

### Senior Leaders in Engineering

The 7CTOs Program is run with 4 Senior leaders in Engineering. The program exists of peer mentoring sessions (forums) and effective network building.

### How to find a mentor or become a mentor at GitLab

There is a program to find a mentor or to become a mentor at GitLab described on [this handbook page](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/mentor/).

### Learning the customer experience

Engineers can gain significant insight from observing customers while they use the portions of the product that those engineers develop. Engineers interested in doing this should contact their team's [assigned UX Researcher](/handbook/product/categories/) to get involved with upcoming customer sessions and access previously recorded sessions.

If a team does not have a UX Researcher assigned, they should reach out on the `#research` Slack channel to express interest. A UX Researcher can jump in and set them up to observe a participant session.

If there is a specific request to shadow a customer as they use the product, this should be coordinated through the team's [assigned Product Manager](/handbook/product/categories/).
