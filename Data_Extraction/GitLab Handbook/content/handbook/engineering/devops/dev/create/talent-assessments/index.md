## Talent Assessments

For company-wide guidance on Talent Assessments, please consult the People Group's [Talent Assessment](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/) page.

## Performance assessment

As described in the main [Talent Assessment > Performance Factor > Measuring Performance](/handbook/people-group/talent-assessment/#job-family-responsibilities-and-functional-competencies) section, the managers look at several Performance Indicators holistically to assess in which Performance box to place a team member.

Let's go over which indicators are taken into account during Talent Assessments to add clarity and establish expectations.

### Performance Indicators

These are the indicators managers might consider when assessing Performance. Not one in isolation, but interconnecting all of them.

Some of these are tracked through Tableau dashboards while others are assessed manually by the manager.

* MR Rate
* Reviews Rate
* Business Results
* Number of projects as Maintainer
* Number of interviews performed
* Mentoring activities
* Security issues fixed/contributed to
* InfraDev work
* Discretionary Bonuses
* TMRG/DIB Initiatives participation
* ...
* (to be completed)

Note: This list is but a start, we aim to complete this and add detail over time.
