## Past Initiatives

Please note all information on this page is for reference and preservation only. None of these programs are currently running.

### Monthly Continuous Learning Call Overview

The Learning and Development (L&D) team previously hosted a monthly Monthly Continuous Learning call. The series was intended to showcase all of the L&D initatives taking place at GitLab as well as provide a space for team members to ask questions. The series was replaced in FY22 with involvement in company-wide Group Conversations in an effor to increase participation and attendance in the calls.

#### Goals

1. Spur a culture of curiosity and continuous learning by highlighting all the initiatives we have taking place in learning & development.
1. Increase engagement and improve team member satisfaction and productivity by advancing understanding of available L&D resources

Additional background information on this initiaitve is available in the [Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/96)

#### Hosting a Monthly Continuous Learning Call

The following process outlines steps for the L&D team to take each month when planning and implementing monthly calls.

**Planning Issue Template:** Open an Monthly Continuous Learning Call issue template in the L&D Project. Steps outlined below are also included in the issue template and are included here as reference.

1. Create a HelpLab request to coordinate a Zoom meeting on the company calendar. This meeting should be set up to live stream to the GitLab unfiltered YouTube channel. Consider hosting the call at least 2 times to best accommodate for multiple time zones.
1. Create slide deck for presentation. Make a copy of a previous month's presention in the [Continuous Learning Campaign Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d4ksJXBMrATATxN0QyJ4FA6hzchMNdvb?usp=sharing)
1. Coordinate slide deck with appropriate enablement audiences (i.e DIB, Field Enablement, Professional Services, Marketing Enablement, etc)
1. Update slide deck for presentation with feedback from coordinated audiences
1. Open a feedback issue for questions and comments to be shared asynchronously.
1. Coordinate an announcement of the call in the #company-fyi Slack channel from Sid or another executive/manager who will be featured that month. The post should be shared 1 business day before the call. This post should include a link to the slide deck and coresponding issue. See notes below for a template that can be shared.

##### Text for CEO share in #company-fyi channel

`Join the Learning and Development team on [DATE] for the Monthly Continuous Learning Call. This month's call is all about [TOPIC]. You can review the slide deck for the call [HERE], and post questions you might have in the call adenga doc [HERE]. Looking forward to seeing you there!`

### Reviews

> Overall I loved the course and the material. It felt very relevant and relatable. I especially liked the prompts that were created for the breakout sessions because it felt like there was a lot of thought put into trying to make the scenarios relevant to how we work at GitLab.
>
> This course taught me alot about myself and how to make improvements when having crucial conversations!
>
> Crucial Conversations course provides a simple-to-understand set of tools and techniques that will help me be more candid and assertive in both professional and personal conversations. The self-paced study combined with weekly live sessions was moderately demanding, it provided nice accountability that nudged me towards learning each week.
>
> This course is fantastic! Within the first week, I was already able to apply real skills to conversations I have every day. I've always considered difficult conversations to be an area where I could really benefit from improvement and now I believe if I continue to practice and improve these skills, I will see significant results both in and out of work.
>
> The Crucial Conversations course helped me understand how I can be a better individual in all aspects of my life. There are a bunch of skills covered in the course that I can use in both my personal life and professional life that will help me better communicate with those around me, and - crucially - be more effective at moving through tough conversations about important topics.

### Hosting a Learning Speaker Series call

The following process outlines steps for the L&D team to take when planning and implementing the calls.

**Planning Issue Template:** Open a `learning-speaker-series` issue template in the L&D [General Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/learning-speaker-series.md) to host a session. Steps outlined below are also included in the issue template and are included here as reference.

1. Collaborate with exec team, mid-level people leaders, and other interested GitLab Team members to gauge interest and availability to be featured in the call. Be mindful to include diverse voices from across the GitLab team.
1. Plan on a quarterly basis if possible. Create a series based on a topic that is high need for managers or ICs at GitLab.
1. Ensure external speakers have been validated and that the topic covered aligns with our values.
1. Create a calendar event and share it with the `GitLab Team Meetings` calendar. Invite the `everyone` alias. Post in the [#people-connect Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C0SNC8F2N/thread/C0SNC8F2N-1602618225.269200) to accept event on the team meetings calendar. Consider hosting the call at least 2 times, or varying session times throughout a quarterly series, to accommodate for multiple time zones.
1. Test Zoom functionality with the speaker at least two business days before event.
    - If external speaker, ensure they have downloaded [Zoom](https://zoom.us/support/download).
    - Have speaker test [audio and video](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom#how-to-test-audio-and-video-in-zoom).
    - Check that speaker will be able to [share a presentation](/handbook/tools-and-tips/zoom#how-to-share-a-presentation-in-zoom) if necessary.
1. Send speaker calendar invite with all details for the call (including, but not limited to, Zoom link, agenda, slides, etc.).
1. Create an agenda for the presentation. GitLab team members can access templates in [this Google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1jHdqyLlHn8syxL9MrRtXSaxB5zY5RubN?ths=true).
1. Coordinate an announcement of the call in the #what's-happening-at-GitLab Slack channel at least 1 business day before the call.
1. Use Canva to create internal marketing that features each speaker's headshot and session title.

### Social Learning Through Live Learning

Social Learning is the cornerstone for how L&D designs, develops, and delivers live learning sessions. Social learning focuses on how team members interact with peers for just-in-time learning and skill acquisition through knowledge retention. Live learnings serve as an opportunity for team members to build relationships and a sense of community with team members. Social Learning occurs when team members come together in a virtual forum synchronously to learn from others through networking, breakout groups, storytelling, lessons learned reflection, and collaboration on solving scenarios with role playing. The live learnings enables learners to pull knowledge fro experts and peers within the organization instead of having knowledge pushed to them.

Example of a Social Learning Live Learning Session on [Building High Performing Teams](/handbook/leadership/#strategies-to-build-high-performing-teams)

{{< youtube "aezVF1nOBWc" >}}

Social Learning can also occur in GitLab's Learning Experience Platform - [Level Up](https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/dashboard) and asynchronous forums using GitLab. (i.e. [Elevate](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/elevate-programs/))

## Learning & Development Quarterly Newsletter

The L&D team hosted a quarterly newsletter for five quarters for the community.

## Take Time Out To Learn Campaign

Focus Friday's are a great benefit at GitLab. We try to schedule minimal meetings on Fridays to catch up on work and grow our skills professionally. Use Focus Fridays to take time out to learn. Team members can work with their manager through a [career development conversation](/handbook/leadership/1-1/#career-development-discussion-at-the-1-1) to determine what skills that want to grow in the future. Aspirations can be documented in an [individual growth plan](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/#resources-and-tools).

From there, identify what will be needed to attain the new skills and consider using the [Growth and Development Benefit](/handbook/total-rewards/benefits/general-and-entity-benefits/#growth-and-development-fund) or [expensing professional development opportunities such as coaching, worskshops, conferencces, self-service learning, etc.](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/growth-and-development/#types-of-growth-and-development-reimbursements). Block time off your calendar every week or month to devote to learning new skills. Share what you are learning with team members and in the `#learninganddevelopment` slack channel.

Consider documenting the steps you are going to take learn new skills in the individual growth plan. Check in with your manager and ask for accountability from them to help you stay aligned with goals.

## Internal Learning Campaigns

Learning campaigns at GitLab have an asynchronous focus and are used to raise awareness around a specific topic or set of resources. These campaigns are inspired by the structure of a learning challenge but without the required engagement or tracking. For example, the L&D team is using a learning campaign structure to host a [mental health awareness week](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/156)

Learning campaigns use a combination of GitLab issues and Slack announcements to raise awareness and spark discussion. Following the campaign, the L&D team will aggregate comments and resources that have surfaced and document in the handbook. Learning campaigns can be used to build buzz around a live speaker series or to start conversation about a common question or issue that GitLab team members are facing.

## CEO Handbook Learning Sessions

GitLab's Handbook pages grow every day. Throughout FY22, the L&D team and the CEO held recorded learning sessions to analyze Handbook pages. The goal of the sessions will be to incorporate more video-based learning into the handbook.

Three types of CEO handbook learning sessions:

1. **Handbook Readout:** Bite-sized recording where the L&D team and the CEO review what is on the page. (5 minute video)
1. **Handbook Discussion:** Interactive discussion where L&D facilitates an engaging conversation with the CEO and e-group members. We openly discuss the concepts on the page and allow senior leaders to share best practices implementing them. (25 minute video)
1. **Handbook Interview:** The Learning and Development team will create new pages, create sub-pages, or update existing pages based on interview topics discussed during a targeted Q&A. The video will serve as the foundation for new learning content at GitLab.

The video below from Sid and L&D further explains the concepts:

{{< youtube "cB301JaYnsw" >}}

Steps for L&D Team when setting up a CEO Handbook Learning Session:

Preparing for the Call:

1. Review topic relevant Handbook pages.
1. Determine what topics you want to cover each week
1. Research the respective page that will be discussed or section of a page
1. Complete some work on the page before the session if you can, create an MR that clarifies information or asks Sid for clarity on the topic discussed.
1. Set up a meeting with CEO through EBA. Invite other e-group members if applicable.
1. Create an agenda with talking points and areas to emphasize during video recording with CEO
1. Send Sid the agenda in the `#CEO` channel at least 24 hours in advance
1. Hold a handbook learning session and ensure the discussion is fluid and interactive with open and honest dialogue.

During the Call:

1. Give CEO and other speakers, if applicable, a few minutes at the beginning of the call to populate answers.
1. Once everyone is ready, stream to YouTube Live.
1. Make the title of the agenda, the same as the YouTube Video.
1. Do a quick introduction.
1. Go through the questions on the agenda.
1. If questions come up during the interview, add them to the end of the agenda if there is time
1. When there's nothing on the agenda left, thank him for his time and end the live stream.

After the Call:

1. Determine if L&D can create bite-sized videos with the content. Post bite-sized and long-form video on YouTube Unfiltered channel
1. Update Unfiltered page with more information after the Live Stream. See the description in this [example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_okcPC9YucA).
1. Edit the live stream thumbnail with a [Title Page](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Pj3bxYK6FFSsiMx2vOAcsB0C6ctl_1lqFH6E5MtgGE/edit#slide=id.gb1c2c2e157_0_115) for each topic. Here is [the template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Pj3bxYK6FFSsiMx2vOAcsB0C6ctl_1lqFH6E5MtgGE/edit#slide=id.gb1c2c2e157_0_115) for the videos. Write out a new title, screenshot the image, and update thumbnail.
1. Embed video on the related Handbook page.
