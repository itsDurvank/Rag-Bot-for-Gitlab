## Leveling Up LevelUp

We're currently rolling out a new platform for LevelUp to better support the pace, demand, complexity, and culture of GitLab. This overhaul will allow team members to engage around learning in a completely different way, that links in with Talent, career pathing, project opportunities, and more.

Learning today goes way beyond self-paced content, far passed webinars, leaps above documents; learning is much much more. And GitLab's new "**LevelUp**" (integrated talent EXPERIENCE platform) will show you just how dynamic learning, growth, skills development, and performance can go. 

Consider this page your LevelUp information highway. Over the coming weeks, you'll see updates, announcements, and rollout plans here.

## What's the difference between LevelUp and GitLab University?

With the launch of this new technology solution, it's important to note that LevelUp and GitLab University our now **two completely separate platforms**, each with a different purpose and audience. GitLab University is used for customer education, whereas LevelUp is designed to support team member learning and professional development.

| | GitLab University | LevelUp |
|---|---|---|
| **Target Audience** | Designed for educating customers and community members | Designed for educating internal team members |
| **Platform** | Runs on ThoughtIndustries Learning System | Runs on Cornerstone Talent Experience Platform |
| **Training Type** | Delivers external-facing product training | Delivers internal training for team members - including product, professional development, and compliance training |

If you'd like to take any courses / certifications that are currently hosted on GitLab University, don't worry, we'll make them accessible via LevelUp.

## Benefits and Features

The new Cornerstone Talent Experience Platform (TXP) offers significant improvements over our current learning management system, and is specifically designed to support internal employee development and career growth at GitLab. Key features include:

- Internal gigs and side projects to provide hands-on learning opportunities
- Enhanced management tools for training assignment and recommendations
- Advanced user-generated content capabilities
- Seamless integration with our talent management infrastructure, ensuring skills development is reflected in performance data
- Skills library linked to GitLab job architecture 

## Project Team

- Tre Ely - Sr Director Talent Management & Development
- Jamie Allen - Sr Talent Development Program Manager
- Michelle Bencomo - Sr Program Manager, People Leadership Group

## Timeline

The system is currently live for our engineering and security divisions, details on the company wide rollout to follow, but all team members will have access by the end of Q2. 

## FAQs

- **I completed a number of learning courses in the Legacy platform, what will happen to my learning data?**
- Your learning history may not be migrated when you first login to the new LevelUp system, but all team members' learning data is preserved, and will be migrated as the system over the next weeks and months, team members don't need to take any action.
- You do not need to retake any courses you've already completed.

- **I've noticed somethiing in the new system that isn't working properly, or would like to give feedback on a platform feature, who should I tell?**
- Please share any feedback in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830).

- **When will I lose access to the legacy system?**
- The legacy Level Up system uses the same vendor (ThoughtIndustries), as GitLab University, which serves our partnes and customers with GitLab product training and education content. Therefore the system won't be going away, but we will likely sunset it for team members at some point. We'll announce more when a full timeline is planned, but access won't be restricted, and it is expected to be after Q2.
- For a transition period, you'll still have access to both systems.

- **Will all content be migrated to the new system?**
- We are conducting a full content audit from the legacy system, and all relevant content will be migrated to the new LevelUp. If you notice something missing that should be added, please let us know in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830), or the #learninganddevelopment slack channel.

- **How do I login to the new system?**
- Access will be granted via Okta - search the LevelUp Okta tile.

- **I have a question about how something works in LevelUp, who should I ask?**
- Please let us know in the [LevelUp feedback issue here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/learning-development/general/-/issues/830).

- **I have started a course, but my progress bar shows 0% completion. Is my progress lost?**
- Some courses only report completion, not the ongoing progress. The LevelUp progress bar will reflect it once you finish the course.

**Note**: Following some UX updates, you can now access the 'Create' option by navigating to More > Tools > Manage Content > 'Create New', or just head to [https://levelup.edcast.com/content](https://levelup.edcast.com/content)

### Smartcards

The basic unit of content in LevelUp. A SmartCard is a single piece of learning material like a video, article, quiz, or link to helpful resources.

> **Note:** By default, all users can create SmartCards, but if you're interested in putting a Pathway together, please open an access request to be a course author in LevelUp, and assign it to @jallen16, who can uplift your access permissions.

#### How to Create a SmartCard in LevelUp

Creating a SmartCard is simple and allows you to share valuable learning content with your team or the wider organization.

**Basic Steps**

1. From the LevelUp homepage, click the Create button in the top navigation bar
1. Select SmartCard from the options
1. Choose the type of content you want to share (article, video, link, etc.)
1. Add the URL or upload your content
1. Fill in the title and description
1. Set the estimated time to complete
1. Add relevant tags to make your content discoverable
1. Choose whether the content should be public or private
1. Click Create to publish your SmartCard

**Best Practices**

- Clear Titles: Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate what the content is about
- Add Instructions: Include a brief note telling learners what to do with the content
- Set Accurate Time Estimates: Be realistic about how long it will take to consume the content
- Use Relevant Tags: Add specific tags to help others discover your content
- Consider Privacy Settings: Create SmartCards independently (outside of pathways) if you want them to be reusable across the platform
- Add to Channels: Share your SmartCard to relevant channels to increase visibility
- Quality Over Quantity: Focus on sharing truly valuable content that addresses specific learning needs

Remember, SmartCards created within a Pathway will only be discoverable in that Pathway, while SmartCards created independently can be discovered and used across the platform.

Watch the video below for a walkthrough on how to create Smartcards:

### Journeys

Larger learning experiences made up of multiple Pathways. Journeys offer comprehensive learning on a topic by combining several related Pathways into chapters or sections.

### Channels

Topic-based collections of content that help you discover learning materials on specific subjects. You can follow channels to stay updated when new content is added.

### Groups

Communities of learners organized around teams, departments, or shared interests. Groups allow content to be shared with specific audiences.

### Manager Dashboard

A tool for managers to view their team's learning activity, assign content to team members, and track progress on assigned learning materials.

### Skills

In Cornerstone, skills are the metadata that describe what you can do and know - like professional DNA that the system tracks and analyzes. They help connect you with the right learning content, projects, and opportunities to grow your capabilities, in keeping with your career and development goals.

## Early Access for Compliance Training

While LevelUp is being rolled out division by division, some team members outside of Engineering and Security are being granted early access to complete required compliance training. This ensures all team members can complete their mandatory training in one consistent platform. Compliance training was previously deployed through NavexENGAGE and other platforms; we will now centralize all compliance trainings on LevelUp. 

### What you need to know

If you've been granted early access for compliance training:

- Your access is currently limited to the compliance training section of LevelUp
- You can complete and track your assigned compliance courses
- Full platform access will be available when your division is rolled out (by end of Q2)
- You've been enrolled in:
  - **Code of Conduct**: Ethical decision-making and workplace guidance
  - **Regulation FD**: Material information handling and disclosure practices
- **Due Date**: (2025-07-11) July 11, 2025
