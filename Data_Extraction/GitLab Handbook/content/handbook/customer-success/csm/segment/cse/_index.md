### **CSE Operating Rhythm**

The [CSE operating rhythm](/handbook/customer-success/csm/segment/cse/cse-operating-rhythm/) outlines procedures CSEs use to engage with customers as well as how account owners can request CSE engagement outside of the normal operating rhythm during the customer lifecycle.

[For the ARR thresholds for the CSE customer segment please reference this Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/csm/-/wikis/CSM-Segments) (GitLab Internal).
