## Professional Services: What, Why and How

### What

So you've won a customer's business with a subscription deal to use Gitlab, congratulations! Now you can focus on establishing a foundation of trust to grow the relationship. In order for your customer to get the most out of GitLab consider engaging them with Professional Services.

Our team can help your customer accelerate their GitLab Adoption journey from Onboarding to Source Code Management Consolidation, CI/CD Modernization, DevSecOps Transformation, and Value Stream Management by delivering services to improve operational efficiency, accelerate time to market and reduce risk through GitLab product adoption.

We accomplish these by offering [categories of services](https://about.gitlab.com/professional-services/) to help ensure the initial GitLab rollout goes smoothly so the end users can get value as fast as possible.

#### Migration Services

We offer data and user migration services to enable the customer to come from a variety of legacy systems (both SCM and CI/CD). We work closely with the GitLab import API team and have automation tools to facilitate the migration. We are continuously improving them with every nuanced customer migration service we provide. 

Migration services are always custom-scoped because of the variability of level of effort based on the amount of data and number of users in the source system(s), except for our [Migration QuickStart SKU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dPs65e23bzlBQ_DxXbAkzZl-6t5OkFzZ/view), which supports a smaller, more controlled migration at a fixed cost. 

#### Implementation Services

When customers choose GitLab Self-Managed, they typically need help building and configuring their software to meet their non-functional requirements (e.g. Availability, Performance, Security, Upgrade, GEO, Disaster Recovery, etc.). Our team of experts maintains an [Implementation delivery kit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/delivery-kits/implementation-delivery-kits) to facilitate this while leveraging [gitlab reference architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/) best practices.

For GitLab.com users, focus mostly on how to organize GitLab groups and projects, how to establish role based access control, and other front end strategic decisions that typically need to be made up-front.

The Implementation QuickStart GitLab.com and Self-Managed (HA) packages have a standard SKU, but have specific bounds to the large cloud service providers and HA/DR architectural patterns. If your customers' needs fall outside of those bounds, you will need to engage in a [custom-scoping exercise](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/selling/#custom-scoped-services).

#### Education Services

As with any new software being introduced at a company, users tend to need training to know how to use it. We have excellent [education services](https://about.gitlab.com/services/education/) that span the spectrum of basics to advanced; administrators to general users. All of our education services have standard SKUs, which makes the process easy for the ISR/SAE to offer to a customer. We've also begun to offer custom education services as well as scaled trainings to Customers.

#### CI/CD Services

We discussed in the migration services about moving data from source CI/CD systems over to GitLab CI, but we also offer a [CI/CD Workshop SKU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10RzC-e0fhvgKBRaoZlxEgUQc90Z_0IVR/view) that allows us to demo GitLab CI features and then provide strategy and roadmapping advisory sessions to Customers to ease their adoption of GitLab CI. Additionally, we offer T&M services to help with large scale and/or custom CI/CD modernization efforts.

#### Security Services

With GitLab Ultimate, Professional Services can deliver a [DevSecOps Workshop SKU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZm_DiwPdtssFqBolrDqPooaH6kA5Y5u/view) that allows us to demo key GitLab Ultimate security features and then provide strategy and roadmapping advisory sessions to Customers to ease their adoption of GitLab Ultimate. Additionally, we offer T&M services to help with large scale and/or custom Security transformation efforts. 

### Why GitLab Professional Services?

#### Customer

- **Faster value realization** - Help the customer setup the GitLab instance and migrate their data and users quickly to accelerate [time to first value](/handbook/customer-success/customer-success-vision/#time-to-value-kpis). Paired with education services to ensure the users know how to use the newly setup GitLab system is the way to the fastest initial adoption and sets the foundation for future stage adoption.
- **Improved customer experience** - Establishing best practices up front with our expert recommendations is the path to a great customer experience.
- **Access to GitLab experts / best practices** - On top of our team of experts, we can reach back to engineering and support to put the full weight of GitLab into solving a customer issue.

#### GitLab

- **Improved retention and expansion** - When customers get started with GitLab on the right foot, they spend less time on debt work (e.g. infrastructure maintenance or ) throughout their subscription period
- **Customer insights and feedback** - The PS Engineer will be working hands-on with the customer team and often gains insightful feedback on the software and customer relationship.

## How to order

Ordering services is done through an **Off-the-shelf SKU** or a custom-scoped **Statement of Work**.  See the [selling services workflow](/handbook/customer-success/professional-services-engineering/selling/) for more details.
For custom SOWs, initiate the PS epic and associated scoping issue process to capture the requirement by creating a child PS opportunity off of a parent license or subscription SFDC opportunity using the `Create Services Opportunity` button, and collaborate with your local [Professional Services Engagement Manager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bdVOf3jL6aJF79qRMFLQsmMxIgQh5ZQ-WiLuNgsWB08/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.qzgxpwqxme5).
