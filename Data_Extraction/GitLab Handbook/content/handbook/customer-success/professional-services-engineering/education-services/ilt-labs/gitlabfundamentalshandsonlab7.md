## Objectives

## Task A. Viewing your analytics

To start, navigate to your `Cool App QA` project.

1. In the left sidebar, select **Analyze > Analytics Dashboard**.

1. Select **Value Streams Dashboard**.

In this report, you will see a variety of analytic details about your current project. Some details you may see populated here after the previous labs are: Merge request throughput, and Median time to merge.

1. In the left sidebar, select **Analyze > CI/CD Analytics**.

In this report, you will see details about your Ci/CD pipelines. Here you can see how many pipelines have run in your project, the duration of the pipelines, and failure rates of pipelines.

1. Take some time to explore the other analytics reports available. Review any insights that seem interesting!

It's important to note here that you can also view analytics at a group level. To do this, navigate to your **QA** group. In the left sidebar, you can select **Analyze** and see similar reports for everything contained in a group.
