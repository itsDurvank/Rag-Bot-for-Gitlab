The Embody Team is a small team focused on experimental functionality.

## Vision

To discover and develop the next generation of DevSecOps innovations through fearless experimentation and rapid iteration.

## Priorities

Our current priority is to understand which observability functionality users want to use in GitLab.

## Projects

- [Experimental Observability](https://gitlab.com/groups/experimental-observability)

## Contact

- General Slack: [#embody-team](https://app.slack.com/client/T02592416/C0845DKFB52)

### All Team Members

- [Ren√©e Hendricksen](/handbook/company/team/#reneehendricksen)
- [Sid Sijbrandij](/handbook/company/team/#sytses)

## Labels

- `group::embody`

### PTO

We follow the [Engineering process for taking time off](/handbook/engineering/#taking-time-off) and [GitLab team members Guide to Time Off](/handbook/people-group/paid-time-off/#a-gitlab-team-members-guide-to-time-off).

## Skills

Because we have a wide range of domains to cover, it requires a lot of different expertise and skills:

| Technology skills | Areas of interest    |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Ruby on Rails     | Backend development  |
| Go                | Backend development  |
| Vue, Vuex, React  | Frontend development |
| GraphQL           | *Various*            |
| SQL (PostgreSQL)  | *Various*            |
| Docker/Kubernetes | *Various*     |

## Everyone can contribute

At GitLab our goal is that [everyone can contribute](/handbook/company/mission/#contribute-to-gitlab-application). This applies to GitLab team members and the wider community through community contributions. We welcome contributions to any and all features, but recognize that first time contributors may prefer to start with smaller features. To support this we maintain a list of `quick wins` that may be more suitable for first time contributors, and contributors new to the domains in Software Supply Chain Security.

If the contributor needs an EE license, we can point towards the [Contributing to the GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE)](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/contributor-success/community-contributors-workflows/#contributing-to-the-gitlab-enterprise-edition-ee) section on the Community contributors workflows page.
