## Usage guidelines and FAQs

RPlease refer to the [General Purpose AI Tool Usage Guidelines](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/ai-tool-usage-guidelines/) for guidance on the use of general purpose AI tools in your work at GitLab.

### Other approved AI tools

Some AI features in existing Tech Stack systems may also be approved for use. To learn more, see the [General Purpose AI Tool Usage Guidelines](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/ai-tool-usage-guidelines/).

#### Prohibited AI tools

Examples of tools that are not permitted for use at GitLab:

* OpenAI ChatGPT.
* Microsoft/GitHub Copilot.
* Google Chrome AI features (for example: “Help me write”).
* [Apple Intelligence.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/2421)
* Third-party platforms that connect to Claude that aren’t themselves approved (you can request approval of the third-party platform via [the processes described in this section](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/ai-tool-usage-guidelines/#other-ai-tools)). These platforms need to be approved themselves because they are not subject to our Anthropic agreement and so do not have the legal protections from that agreement.
* Tools that violate our [GitLab Duo dogfooding principle](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/ai-at-gitlab/#what) such as (for example: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) and [Cline](https://cline.bot/)). Team members may be permitted to use Cursor and Cline for competitive research purposes provided they review and follow [our guidelines for competitive use](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/ai-tool-usage-guidelines/#competitive-analysis).
* Anthropic API keys for any use-case [not already approved](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/legal-and-corporate-affairs/legal-privacy/#requests-for-anthropic-api-key-use).
