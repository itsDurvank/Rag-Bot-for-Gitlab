### Introduction

Hello! My name is Arif Willis-Browne. I'm a IT Enterprise Engineer" with the [IT Enterprise Applications Services](//handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/enterprise-applications/entapps-services/) division.

### About me

I currently reside in UK, London with my wife and kids, and have lived here my whole life. When I am not busy, I am usually watching a Netflix show with my family or outdoors in the soft play park running around with my children. On the work front, I come from a software engineer background and have worked for multiple organisations over the past 15+ years before having a pleasure to joining my amazing team at Gitlab.

### How I work

I generally prefer an informal approach with communication as it helps me build a personal relationship with people. One common method I strongly advocate is using Slack, which is my best form of communication. There is no such thing as a 'silly' question; any questions you have, please fire away and I will do my best to assist the best I can.

### What I am working on

- My primary focus is on integration, automation and system architecture within the NetSuite ERP space.
- I am a major contributor to our NetSuite ERP system, automating integrations with other 3rd party systems, as well as streamlining processes for our finance teams, improving user experiences, and collaborating on projects with other team members.
